PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Rearrangements of the histone lysine [K]-MethylTransferase 2A 
gene (KMT2A) gene on chromosome 11q23, formerly known as the mixed-lineage 
leukemia (MLL) gene, are found in 10% and 5% of adult and children ALL cases, 
respectively. The most common translocated genes are AFF1 (formerly AF4), MLLT3 
(formerly AF9), and MLLT1 (formerly ENL). The bimodal incidence of MLL-r-ALL 
usually peaks in infants in their first 2 years of life and then declines 
thereafter during the pediatric/young adult phase until it increases again with 
age. MLL-rearranged ALL (MLL-r-ALL) is characterized by hyperleukocytosis, 
aggressive behavior with early relapse, relatively high incidence of central 
nervous system (CNS) involvement, and poor prognosis.
RECENT FINDINGS: MLL-r-ALL cells are characterized by relative resistance to 
corticosteroids (due to Src kinase-induced phosphorylation of annexin A2) and 
L-asparaginase therapy, but they are sensitive to cytarabine chemotherapy (due 
to increased levels of hENT1 expression). Potential therapeutic targets include 
FLT3 inhibitors, MEK inhibitors, HDAC inhibitors, BCL-2 inhibitors, MCL-1 
inhibitors, proteasome inhibitors, hypomethylating agents, Dot1L inhibitors, and 
CDK inhibitors. In this review, we discuss MLL-r-ALL focusing on clinical 
presentation, risk stratification, drug resistance, and treatment strategies, 
including potential novel therapeutic targets.

Extranodal lymphomas (ENLs) comprise about a third of all non-Hodgkin lymphomas 
(NHL). Radiation therapy (RT) is frequently used as either primary therapy 
(particularly for indolent ENL), consolidation after systemic therapy, salvage 
treatment, or palliation. The wide range of presentations of ENL, involving any 
organ in the body and the spectrum of histological sub-types, poses a challenge 
both for routine clinical care and for the conduct of prospective and 
retrospective studies. This has led to uncertainty and lack of consistency in RT 
approaches between centers and clinicians. Thus far there is a lack of 
guidelines for the use of RT in the management of ENL. This report presents an 
effort by the International Lymphoma Radiation Oncology Group (ILROG) to 
harmonize and standardize the principles of treatment of ENL, and to address the 
technical challenges of simulation, volume definition and treatment planning for 
the most frequently involved organs. Specifically, detailed recommendations for 
RT volumes are provided. We have applied the same modern principles of involved 
site radiation therapy as previously developed and published as guidelines for 
Hodgkin lymphoma and nodal NHL. We have adopted RT volume definitions based on 
the International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements (ICRU), as has 
been widely adopted by the field of radiation oncology for solid tumors. 
Organ-specific recommendations take into account histological subtype, anatomy, 
the treatment intent, and other treatment modalities that may be have been used 
before RT.

Polycomb group (PcG) repress, whereas Trithorax group (TrxG) activate 
transcription for tissue development and cellular proliferation, and 
misregulation of these factors is often associated with cancer. ENL (MLLT1) and 
AF9 (MLLT3) are fusion partners of Mixed Lineage Leukemia (MLL), TrxG proteins, 
and are factors in Super Elongation Complex (SEC). SEC controls transcriptional 
elongation to release RNA polymerase II, paused around transcription start site. 
In MLL rearranged leukemia, several components of SEC have been found as 
MLL-fusion partners and the control of transcriptional elongation is 
misregulated leading to tumorigenesis in MLL-SEC fused Leukemia. It has been 
suggested that unexpected collaboration of ENL/AF9-MLL and PcG are involved in 
tumorigenesis in leukemia. Recently, we found that the collaboration of ENL/AF9 
and PcG led to a novel mechanism of transcriptional switch from elongation to 
repression under ATM-signaling for genome integrity. Activated ATM 
phosphorylates ENL/AF9 in SEC, and the phosphorylated ENL/AF9 binds BMI1 and 
RING1B, a heterodimeric E3-ubiquitin-ligase complex in Polycomb Repressive 
complex 1 (PRC1), and recruits PRC1 at transcriptional elongation sites to 
rapidly repress transcription. The ENL/AF9 in SEC- and PcG-mediated 
transcriptional repression promotes DSB repair near transcription sites. The 
implication of this is that the collaboration of ENL/AF9 in SEC and PcG ensures 
a rapid response of transcriptional switching from elongation to repression to 
neighboring genotoxic stresses for DSB repair. Therefore, these results 
suggested that the collaboration of ENL/AF9 and PcG in transcriptional control 
is required to maintain genome integrity and may be link to the MLL-ENL/AF9 
leukemia.

Recurrent chromosomal translocations producing a chimaeric MLL oncogene give 
rise to a highly aggressive acute leukaemia associated with poor clinical 
outcome. The preferential involvement of chromatin-associated factors as MLL 
fusion partners belies a dependency on transcription control. Despite recent 
progress made in targeting chromatin regulators in cancer, available therapies 
for this well-characterized disease remain inadequate, prompting the need to 
identify new targets for therapeutic intervention. Here, using unbiased 
CRISPR-Cas9 technology to perform a genome-scale loss-of-function screen in an 
MLL-AF4-positive acute leukaemia cell line, we identify ENL as an unrecognized 
gene that is specifically required for proliferation in vitro and in vivo. To 
explain the mechanistic role of ENL in leukaemia pathogenesis and dynamic 
transcription control, a chemical genetic strategy was developed to achieve 
targeted protein degradation. Acute loss of ENL suppressed the initiation and 
elongation of RNA polymerase II at active genes genome-wide, with pronounced 
effects at genes featuring a disproportionate ENL load. Notably, an intact YEATS 
chromatin-reader domain was essential for ENL-dependent leukaemic growth. 
Overall, these findings identify a dependency factor in acute leukaemia and 
suggest a mechanistic rationale for disrupting the YEATS domain in disease.

Epigenetic programs are dysregulated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and help 
enforce an oncogenic state of differentiation arrest. To identify key epigenetic 
regulators of AML cell fate, we performed a differentiation-focused CRISPR 
screen in AML cells. This screen identified the histone acetyltransferase KAT6A 
as a novel regulator of myeloid differentiation that drives critical 
leukemogenic gene-expression programs. We show that KAT6A is the initiator of a 
newly described transcriptional control module in which KAT6A-catalyzed promoter 
H3K9ac is bound by the acetyl-lysine reader ENL, which in turn cooperates with a 
network of chromatin factors to induce transcriptional elongation. Inhibition of 
KAT6A has strong anti-AML phenotypes in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that KAT6A 
small-molecule inhibitors could be of high therapeutic interest for mono-therapy 
or combinatorial differentiation-based treatment of AML.
SIGNIFICANCE: AML is a poor-prognosis disease characterized by differentiation 
blockade. Through a cell-fate CRISPR screen, we identified KAT6A as a novel 
regulator of AML cell differentiation. Mechanistically, KAT6A cooperates with 
ENL in a "writer-reader" epigenetic transcriptional control module. These 
results uncover a new epigenetic dependency and therapeutic opportunity in AML.

ENL/MLLT1 is a distinctive member of the KMT2 family based on its structural 
homology. ENL is a histone acetylation reader and a critical component of the 
super elongation complex. ENL plays pivotal roles in the regulation of chromatin 
remodelling and gene expression of many important proto-oncogenes, such as Myc, 
Hox genes, via histone acetylation. Novel insights of the key role of the YEATS 
domain of ENL in the transcriptional control of leukemogenic gene expression has 
emerged from whole genome Crisp-cas9 studies in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In 
this review, we have summarized what is currently known about the structure and 
function of the ENL molecule. We described the ENL's role in normal 
hematopoiesis, and leukemogenesis. We have also outlined the detailed molecular 
mechanisms underlying the regulation of target gene expression by ENL, as well 
as its major interacting partners and complexes involved. Finally, we discuss 
the emerging knowledge of different approaches for the validation of ENL as a 
therapeutic target and the development of small-molecule inhibitors disrupting 
the YEATS reader pocket of ENL protein, which holds great promise for the 
treatment of AML. This review will not only provide a fundamental understanding 
of the structure and function of ENL and update on the roles of ENL in AML, but 
also the development of new therapeutic strategies.

YEATS domain (YD) containing proteins are an emerging class of epigenetic 
targets in drug discovery. Dysregulation of these modified lysine-binding 
proteins has been linked to the onset and progression of cancers. We herein 
report the discovery and characterisation of the first small-molecule chemical 
probe, SGC-iMLLT, for the YD of MLLT1 (ENL/YEATS1) and MLLT3 (AF9/YEATS3). 
SGC-iMLLT is a potent and selective inhibitor of MLLT1/3-histone interactions. 
Excellent selectivity over other human YD proteins (YEATS2/4) and bromodomains 
was observed. Furthermore, our probe displays cellular target engagement of 
MLLT1 and MLLT3. The first small-molecule X-ray co-crystal structures with the 
MLLT1 YD are also reported. This first-in-class probe molecule can be used to 
understand MLLT1/3-associated biology and the therapeutic potential of 
small-molecule YD inhibitors.

Leprosy is an infectious disease caused by the intracellular bacillus 
Mycobacterium leprae that mainly affects the skin and peripheral nerves. One of 
the most intriguing aspects of leprosy is the diversity of its clinical forms. 
Paucibacillary patients are characterized as having less than five skin lesions 
and rare bacilli while the lesions in multibacillary patients are disseminated 
with voluminous bacilli. The chronic course of leprosy is often interrupted by 
acute episodes of an inflammatory immunological response classified as either 
reversal reaction or erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL). Although ENL is considered 
a neutrophilic immune-complex mediated condition, little is known about the 
direct role of neutrophils in ENL and leprosy disease overall. Recent studies 
have shown a renewed interest in neutrophilic biology. One of the most 
interesting recent discoveries was that the neutrophilic population is not 
homogeneous. Neutrophilic polarization leads to divergent phenotypes (e.g., a 
pro- and antitumor profile) that are dynamic subpopulations with distinct 
phenotypical and functional abilities. Moreover, there is emerging evidence 
indicating that neutrophils expressing CD64 favor systemic inflammation during 
ENL. In the present review, neutrophilic involvement in leprosy is discussed 
with a particular focus on ENL and the potential of neutrophils as clinical 
biomarkers and therapeutic targets.

Genome wide transcriptional profiles offer abundant information regarding mRNA 
levels in specific tissues, organs or developmental stages. Although these data 
sets do not offer spatial or cell type-specific information, they can be 
extremely useful for gene discovery when analyzed by the appropriate techniques. 
Previously, we proposed and validated the use of combinatorial dataset analysis 
techniques to identify novel genes required during pre-implantation development. 
Now we build upon this work to identify genes that have dynamic expression 
during gametogenesis. Here we present detailed analysis of the expression 
pattern of leukemia-associated, myeloid/lymphoid or mixed-lineage leukemia; 
translocated to 1 (Mllt1) gene. We document a novel splice isoform of Mllt1 and 
confirm that both Mllt1 mRNA isoforms are translated. We provide data supporting 
that MLLT1 protein isoforms display distinct stage-specific expression during 
spermiogenesis and adult tissues. Finally, we evaluated genes neighboring the 
Mllt1 locus, and show dynamic stage specific expression patterns of other genes 
Catsperd, Prr22, Rfx2 and Slc25a41. We document testes expressed alternative 
isoforms of Prr22 and Rfx2. These results indicate that transcriptome data 
mining, combined with specific expression analysis provides a wealth of novel 
gene expression information.

MLLT1 (ENL/LTG19) is one of a number of fusion gene partners with the MLL 
oncogene involved in 11q23 translocations in human leukemia and encodes a 
transcriptional regulator of unknown function. Leukemias bearing MLL 
translocations may be myeloid or lymphoid or bear mixed lineage properties; 
however, those bearing MLL/MLLT1 translocations are predominantly lymphoid, 
suggesting that MLLT1 may influence the leukemic phenotype. The murine homolog 
Mllt1 exhibits 86% amino acid sequence identity with the human gene and is 
broadly expressed in murine tissues and cell lines, with the exception of liver 
and myeloid cell lines. We have mapped Mllt1 to mouse chromosome 17 band E2 
using FISH analysis. The genomic structure and 5' regulatory sequence of Mllt1 
are highly conserved between mouse and human. There is also conservation of the 
genomic structure, but not the promoter, between MLLT1 and MLLT3/AF9, a 
homologous gene that is also an MLL translocation partner in human leukemias 
with a predominant myeloid phenotype. Targeted disruption of Mllt1 in mice leads 
to embryonic lethality prior to 8.5 dpc. These studies indicate that MLLT1 is 
involved in essential developmental processes and suggest that expression 
patterns of MLL fusion partners may influence the lineage of MLL-associated 
leukemias.

Lignans are secondary plant constituents with dibenzylbutane skeletons found in 
cereals, oilseeds, and nuts. Two members of this class, syringaresinol (Syr) and 
secoisolariciresinol (Seco), occur at relatively high levels in cereals and 
processed food products as well as in coniferous trees. In vitro studies have 
shown that Seco and its metabolites enterodiol (END) and enterolactone (ENL), 
which are formed by intestinal microbes, exhibit strong antioxidant activity 
because of their phenolic character. The biological activity and discussion of 
dietary supplementation with these substances led to questions about the 
potential adverse health effects of these compounds, which are explored here. 
Syr and the metabolites END and ENL were investigated by combining structural 
information generated in silico with practical testing in vitro. An in silico 
structure-activity analysis was performed using ToxTree and NexusPrediction to 
suggest plausible mechanisms of toxicity and estimate toxicological endpoints of 
these compounds. Structural alerts were generated based on the presence of 
phenolic units with coordinating substituents that could potentially form 
quinoid structures, promote reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, bind to 
cellular structures, or damage chromosomes. To assess the in silico results, the 
cytotoxicity and genotoxic potential of the studied compounds were tested in 
vitro using the resazurin reduction and comet assays, respectively. Incubating 
HepG2 and HT29 cells for 1 h or 24 h with 0-100 μM Syr, END, or ENL induced no 
cytotoxic effects. Additionally, even the highest tested concentrations of END 
and ENL showed no modulation of background and total DNA damage. The initial in 
silico screen thus generated structural alerts linked to toxicological 
endpoints, but experimental assessments of the studied compounds revealed no 
detectable toxicity, demonstrating the need for individual mechanistic 
experimental verification of in silico predictions. This approach makes it 
possible to connect known biological activity, such as reported antioxidative 
effects, to underlying mechanisms such as proton abstraction or donation. This 
in turn can yield insights - for example, that a compound's tendency to act as a 
pro- or anti-oxidant (and hence to exert adverse or beneficial health effects) 
may depend on its concentration and the cellular state.

Erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL), also known as type 2 reaction (T2R) is an 
immune complex mediated (type III hypersensitivity) reactional state encountered 
in patients with borderline lepromatous and lepromatous leprosy (BL and LL) 
either before, during, or after the institution of anti-leprosy treatment (ALT). 
The consequences of ENL may be serious, leading to permanent nerve damage and 
deformities, constituting a major cause of leprosy-related morbidity. The 
incidence of ENL is increasing with the increasing number of multibacillary 
cases. Although the diagnosis of ENL is not difficult to make for physicians 
involved in the care of leprosy patients, its management continues to be a most 
challenging aspect of the leprosy eradication program: the chronic and recurrent 
painful skin lesions, neuritis, and organ involvement necessitates prolonged 
treatment with prednisolone, thalidomide, and anti-inflammatory and 
immunosuppressive drugs, which further adds to the existing morbidity. In 
addition, the use of immunosuppressants like methotrexate, azathioprine, 
cyclosporine, or biologics carries a risk of reactivation of persisters 
(Mycobacterium leprae), apart from their own end-organ toxicities. Most ENL 
therapeutic guidelines are primarily designed for acute episodes and there is 
scarcity of literature on management of patients with chronic and recurrent ENL. 
It is difficult to predict which patients will develop chronic or recurrent ENL 
and plan the treatment accordingly. We need simple point-of-care or ELISA-based 
tests from blood or skin biopsy samples, which can help us in identifying 
patients who are likely to require prolonged treatment and also inform us about 
the prognosis of reactions so that appropriate therapy may be started and 
continued for better ENL control in such patients. There is a significant unmet 
need for research for better understanding the immunopathogenesis of, and 
biomarkers for, ENL to improve clinical stratification and therapeutics. In this 
review we will discuss the potential of neutrophils (polymorphonuclear 
granulocytes) as putative diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers by virtue of 
their universal abundance in human blood, functional versatility, phenotypic 
heterogeneity, metabolic plasticity, differential hierarchical cytoplasmic 
granule mobilization, and their ability to form NETs (neutrophil extracellular 
traps). We will touch upon the various aspects of neutrophil biology relevant to 
ENL pathophysiology in a step-wise manner. We also hypothesize about an element 
of metabolic reprogramming of neutrophils by M. leprae that could be 
investigated and exploited for biomarker discovery. In the end, a potential role 
for neutrophil derived exosomes as a novel biomarker for ENL will also be 
explored.

The Intrinsically Disordered Proteins MLLT3 (AF9) and MLLT1 (ENL) - Multimodal 
Transcriptional Switches With Roles in Normal Hematopoiesis, MLL Fusion 
Leukemia, and Kidney Cancer.

AF9 (MLLT3) and ENL (MLLT1) are members of the YEATS family (named after the 
five proteins first shown to contain this domain: Yaf9, ENL, AF9, Taf14, Sas5) 
defined by the presence of a YEATS domain. The YEATS domain is an epigenetic 
reader that binds to acetylated and crotonylated lysines, unlike the bromodomain 
which can only bind to acetylated lysines. All members of this family have been 
shown to be components of various complexes with roles in chromatin remodeling, 
histone modification, histone variant deposition, and transcriptional 
regulation. MLLT3 is a critical regulator of hematopoiesis with a role in 
maintaining the hematopoietic stem or progenitor cell (HSPC) population. 
Approximately 10% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphocytic leukemia 
(ALL) patients harbor a translocation involving MLL (mixed lineage leukemia). In 
the context of MLL fusion patients with AML and ALL, MLL-AF9 and MLL-ENL fusions 
are observed in 34 and 31% of the patients, respectively. The intrinsically 
disordered C-terminal domain of MLLT3 (AHD, ANC1 homology domain) undergoes 
coupled binding and folding upon interaction with partner proteins AF4, DOT1L, 
BCOR, and CBX8. Backbone dynamics studies of the complexes suggest a role for 
dynamics in function. Inhibitors of the interaction of the intrinsically 
disordered AHD with partner proteins have been described, highlighting the 
feasibility of targeting intrinsically disordered regions. MLLT1 undergoes phase 
separation to enhance recruitment of the super elongation complex (SEC) and 
drive transcription. Mutations in MLLT1 observed in Wilms tumor patients enhance 
phase separation and transcription to drive an aberrant gene expression program.

Erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) is a manifestation of type II lepra reaction, 
seen in lepromatous or borderline lepromatous leprosy. Although it is a common 
reaction encountered in clinical practice, there are an increasingly large 
number of newer updates in the pathophysiology and management of this condition. 
The treatment options have expanded far beyond just thalidomide and steroids and 
now extends to TNF-α inhibitors, thalidomide analogs, tenidap, cyclosporine A, 
plasma exchange, and even IVIG amongst others. These updates and the current 
knowledge of ENL are summarized in this review.

Dysfunction of YEATS-domain-containing MLLT1, an acetyl/acyl-lysine dependent 
epigenetic reader domain, has been implicated in the development of aggressive 
cancers. Mutations in the YEATS domain have been recently reported as a cause of 
MLLT1 aberrant reader function. However, the structural basis for the reported 
alterations in affinity for acetylated/acylated histone has remained elusive. 
Here, we report the crystal structures of both insertion and substitution 
mutants present in cancer, revealing significant conformational changes of the 
YEATS-domain loop 8. Structural comparison demonstrates that not only did such 
alteration alter the binding interface for acetylated/acylated histones, but the 
sequence alterations in the loop in T1 mutant may enable dimeric assembly 
consistent with inducing self-association behavior. Nevertheless, we show that 
also the MLLT1 mutants can be targeted by developed acetyllysine mimetic 
inhibitors with affinities similarly to wild-type. Our report provides a 
structural basis for the altered behaviors and a potential strategy for 
targeting oncogenic MLLT1 mutants.

Wilms tumour is an embryonal tumour of childhood that closely resembles the 
developing kidney. Genomic changes responsible for the development of the 
majority of Wilms tumours remain largely unknown. Here we identify recurrent 
mutations within Wilms tumours that involve the highly conserved YEATS domain of 
MLLT1 (ENL), a gene known to be involved in transcriptional elongation during 
early development. The mutant MLLT1 protein shows altered binding to acetylated 
histone tails. Moreover, MLLT1-mutant tumours show an increase in MYC gene 
expression and HOX dysregulation. Patients with MLLT1-mutant tumours present at 
a younger age and have a high prevalence of precursor intralobar nephrogenic 
rests. These data support a model whereby activating MLLT1 mutations early in 
renal development result in the development of Wilms tumour.

Acute leukemias caused by translocations of the MLL gene at chromosome 11 band 
q23 (11q23) are characterized by a unique gene expression profile. More 
recently, data from several laboratories indicate that the most commonly 
encountered MLL fusion proteins, MLLT1, MLLT3, and AFF1 are found within a 
molecular complex that facilitates the elongation phase of mRNA transcription. 
Mutational analyses suggest that interaction between the MLLT1/3 proteins and 
AFF family proteins are required for experimental transformation of 
hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs). Here, we define a specific pairing of two 
amino acids that creates a salt bridge between MLLT1/3 and AFF proteins that is 
critically important for MLL-mediated transformation of HPCs. Our findings, 
coupled with the newly defined structure of MLLT3 in complex with AFF1, should 
facilitate the development of small molecules that block this amino acid 
interaction and interfere with the activity of the most common MLL oncoproteins.

Lignans are diphenolic plant compounds with potential health modulating 
properties that are absorbed to the circulation and metabolized to the 
enterolignans enterodiol (END) and enterolactone (ENL) by gut microbiota. 
Epidemiological studies have inconsistently shown that a high lignan intake and 
circulating ENL are associated with reduced risk of breast-, prostate-, and 
colorectal cancer as well as cardiovascular disease and total and cause-specific 
mortality. Inconsistencies can be due to interpersonal variation of ENL 
formation or responses. The aim of this review is to identify and evaluate the 
impact of factors influencing variability in plasma concentrations of the main 
enterolignan, ENL. The main determinants of plasma ENL concentrations are intake 
of lignan and lignan-rich foods, composition and activity of intestinal 
microflora, antimicrobial use, nutrient intake, BMI, smoking, sex, and age. 
Composition and activity of the intestinal microbiota appear to be the most 
critical factor governing interpersonal variability in plasma ENL concentration 
followed by the use of antibiotics. Future studies with combined data from gut 
microbiota and metabolomics with food intake and life style data can be used to 
estimate the relative contribution of the different factors to ENL concentration 
in quantitative terms.

Eleven-nineteen leukemia (ENL) protein is a histone acetylation reader essential 
for disease maintenance in acute leukemias, in particular, the mixed-lineage 
leukemia (MLL)-rearranged leukemia. In this study, we carried out 
high-throughput screening of a small-molecule library to identify inhibitors for 
the ENL YEATS domain. Structure-activity relationship studies of the hits and 
structure-based inhibitor design led to two compounds, 11 and 24, with IC50 
values below 100 nM in inhibiting the ENL-acetyl-H3 interaction. Both compounds, 
and their precursor compound 7, displayed strong selectivity toward the ENL 
YEATS domain over all other human YEATS domains. Moreover, 7 exhibited on-target 
inhibition of ENL in cultured cells and a synergistic effect with the 
bromodomain and extraterminal domain inhibitor JQ1 in killing leukemia cells. 
Together, we have developed selective chemical probes for the ENL YEATS domain, 
providing the basis for further medicinal chemistry-based optimization to 
advance both basic and translational research of ENL.

Classic erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) is characterized clinically by abrupt 
eruption of tender erythematous nodules, papules and plaques. Variable atypical 
patterns have been described, for example pustular, bullous, ulcerative, 
necrotic and Sweet's syndrome-like ENL. We aim to review previously reported 
cases of atypical ENL addressing the diagnostic and therapeutic aspects of these 
uncommon presentations. A search of medical literature for all cases of atypical 
ENL was conducted in the PubMed database till 2020. Data of patients with 
atypical ENL were collected and analyzed to describe the epidemiological, 
clinico-histological and therapeutic features. The major five clinically 
described presentations of atypical ENL include vesiculo-bullous lesions (46 % 
of patients), ulcero-necrotic lesions (41 %), erythema multiforme-like lesions 
(28 %), Sweet's syndrome-like lesions (11 %) and pustules (9 %). The skin 
lesions were accompanied by fever and constitutional symptoms in all patients. 
Oral steroids and thalidomide were the main lines of therapy in most of the 
reported patients. Dermatologists and pathologists should keep in mind the 
clinical variability of ENL to avoid misdiagnosis and delayed management. Early 
recognition can help control disease progression and save the patients from 
further complications.

Transcriptional coregulators, which mediate chromatin-dependent transcriptional 
signaling, represent tractable targets to modulate tumorigenic gene expression 
programs with small molecules. Genetic loss-of-function studies have recently 
implicated the transcriptional coactivator, ENL, as a selective requirement for 
the survival of acute leukemia and highlighted an essential role for its 
chromatin reader YEATS domain. Motivated by these discoveries, we executed a 
screen of nearly 300,000 small molecules and identified an amido-imidazopyridine 
inhibitor of the ENL YEATS domain (IC50 = 7 μM). Improvements to the initial 
screening hit were enabled by adopting and expanding upon a SuFEx-based approach 
to high-throughput medicinal chemistry, ultimately demonstrating that it is 
compatible with cell-based drug discovery. Through these efforts, we discovered 
SR-0813, a potent and selective ENL/AF9 YEATS domain inhibitor (IC50 = 25 nM). 
Armed with this tool and a first-in-class ENL PROTAC, SR-1114, we detailed the 
biological response of AML cells to pharmacological ENL disruption for the first 
time. Most notably, we discovered that ENL YEATS inhibition is sufficient to 
selectively suppress ENL target genes, including HOXA9/10, MYB, MYC, and a 
number of other leukemia proto-oncogenes. Cumulatively, our study establishes 
YEATS domain inhibition as a viable approach to disrupt the pathogenic function 
of ENL in acute leukemia and provides the first thoroughly characterized 
chemical probe for the ENL YEATS domain.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a severe inflammatory skin disease caused by a 
combination of genetic, immune, and environmental factors. Intestinal microbiome 
disorders and changes in the immune microenvironment are associated with AD. We 
observed that gut bacterial metabolite enterolactone (ENL) was significantly 
reduced in AD model mice. Notably, patients with early childhood-onset AD 
exhibited decreased sera ENL level compared to the healthy controls, and the ENL 
level was negatively correlated with the SCORAD index. 
Secoisolariciresinol-diglycoside (SDG) is a natural dietary lignan of flaxseeds 
that can be converted by intestinal bacteria to ENL. Repeated applications of 
2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB) were performed on the ear and dorsal skin of 
mice to induce AD-like symptoms and skin lesions. Oral administration of SDG 
significantly decreased serum IgE levels and limited skin inflammation in the 
DNCB-induced AD mice. In addition, SDG treatment strongly limited the Th2 
responses in AD mice. Moreover, we demonstrated that the IL-4 production was 
significantly suppressed by ENL under Th2 polarization conditions via the 
JAK-STAT6 signaling pathway in a concentration-dependent manner. We concluded 
that SDG and its derived metabolite ENL ameliorated AD development by reducing 
the Th2 immune response. These results suggested that SDG and ENL might be 
exploited as potential therapeutic candidates for AD treatment.

Erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) is a painful inflammatory complication of 
leprosy occurring in 50% of lepromatous leprosy patients and 5-10% of borderline 
lepromatous patients. It is a significant cause of economic hardship, morbidity 
and mortality in leprosy patients. Our understanding of the causes of ENL is 
limited. We performed a systematic review of the published literature and 
critically evaluated the evidence for the role of neutrophils, immune complexes 
(ICs), T-cells, cytokines, and other immunological factors that could contribute 
to the development of ENL. Searches of the literature were performed in PubMed. 
Studies, independent of published date, using samples from patients with ENL 
were included. The search revealed more than 20,000 articles of which 146 
eligible studies were included in this systematic review. The studies 
demonstrate that ENL may be associated with a neutrophilic infiltrate, but it is 
not clear whether it is an IC-mediated process or that the presence of ICs is an 
epiphenomenon. Increased levels of tumor necrosis factor-α and other 
pro-inflammatory cytokines support the role of this cytokine in the inflammatory 
phase of ENL but not necessarily the initiation. T-cell subsets appear to be 
important in ENL since multiple studies report an increased CD4+/CD8+ ratio in 
both skin and peripheral blood of patients with ENL. Microarray data have 
identified new molecules and whole pathophysiological pathways associated with 
ENL and provides new insights into the pathogenesis of ENL. Studies of ENL are 
often difficult to compare due to a lack of case definitions, treatment status, 
and timing of sampling as well as the use of different laboratory techniques. A 
standardized approach to some of these issues would be useful. ENL appears to be 
a complex interaction of various aspects of the immune system. Rigorous clinical 
descriptions of well-defined cohorts of patients and a systems biology approach 
using available technologies such as genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, and 
proteomics could yield greater understanding of the condition.

ENL is a transcriptional coactivator that recruits elongation machinery to 
active cis-regulatory elements upon binding of its YEATS domain-a chromatin 
reader module-to acylated lysine side chains. Discovery chemistry for the ENL 
YEATS domain is highly motivated by its significance in acute leukemia 
pathophysiology, but cell-based assays able to support large-scale screening or 
hit validation efforts do not presently exist. Here, we report on the discovery 
of a target engagement assay that allows for high-throughput ligand discovery in 
living cells. This assay is based on the cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA) 
but does not require exposing cells to elevated temperatures, as small-molecule 
ligands are able to stabilize the ENL YEATS domain at 37 °C. By eliminating 
temperature shifts, we developed a simplified target engagement assay that 
requires just two steps: drug treatment and luminescence detection. To 
demonstrate its value for higher throughput applications, we miniaturized the 
assay to a 1536-well format and screened 37 120 small molecules, ultimately 
identifying an acyl-lysine-competitive ENL/AF9 YEATS domain inhibitor.

Role of dietary lignans in the reduction of breast cancer risk.

Lignans are a large group of fiber-associated phenolic compounds widely 
distributed in edible plants. Some of the ingested plant lignans are converted 
by intestinal microbiota to enterolignans, enterodiol (END) and enterolactone 
(ENL), the latter of which has been thought to be the major biologically active 
lignan, and suggested to be associated with low risk of breast cancer. In line 
with this, administration of plant lignans which are further metabolized to ENL, 
or ENL as such, have been shown to inhibit or delay the growth of experimental 
mammary cancer. The mechanism of anticarcinogenic action of ENL is not yet fully 
understood, but there is intriguing evidence for ENL as a modulator of estrogen 
signaling. These findings have generated interest in the use of lignans as 
components of breast cancer risk reducing functional foods. Identification of 
target groups, who would benefit most, is of pivotal importance. Therefore, 
further identification and validation of relevant biomarkers, which can be used 
as indicators of lignan or ENL action and breast cancer risk reduction at 
different stages of the disease, are of importance.

Chromosome translocations involving mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene cause 
acute leukemia with a poor prognosis. MLL is frequently fused with transcription 
cofactors AF4 (~35%), AF9 (25%) or its paralog ENL (10%). The AHD domain of 
AF9/ENL binds to AF4, its paralog AFF4, or histone-H3 lysine-79 (H3K79) 
methyltransferase DOT1L. Formation of AF9/ENL/AF4/AFF4-containing super 
elongation complexes (SEC) and the catalytic activity of DOT1L are essential for 
MLL-rearranged leukemia. Protein-protein interactions (PPI) between AF9/ENL and 
DOT1L/AF4/AFF4 are therefore a potential drug target. Methods: Compound 
screening followed by medicinal chemistry was used to find inhibitors of such 
PPIs, which were examined for their biological activities against MLL-rearranged 
leukemia and other cancer cells. Results: Compound-1 was identified to be a 
novel small-molecule inhibitor of the AF9/ENL-DOT1L/AF4/AFF4 interaction with 
IC50s of 0.9-3.5 µM. Pharmacological inhibition of the PPIs significantly 
reduced SEC and DOT1L-mediated H3K79 methylation in the leukemia cells. Gene 
profiling shows compound-1 significantly suppressed the gene signatures related 
to onco-MLL, DOT1L, HoxA9 and Myc. It selectively inhibited proliferation of 
onco-MLL- or Myc-driven cancer cells and induced cell differentiation and 
apoptosis. Compound-1 exhibited strong antitumor activity in a mouse model of 
MLL-rearranged leukemia. Conclusions: The AF9/ENL-DOT1L/AF4/AFF4 interactions 
are validated to be an anticancer target and compound-1 is a useful in vivo 
probe for biological studies as well as a pharmacological lead for further drug 
development.

Erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) is an immune-mediated complication of leprosy 
presenting with inflammatory skin nodules and involvement of multiple organ 
systems, often running a protracted course. Immune complex production and 
deposition as well as complement activation have long been regarded as the 
principal aetiology of ENL. However, new data show that cell-mediated immunity 
is also important. We have performed a critical analysis of studies on the 
pathology of ENL. Our main findings are as follows. ENL is characterised by an 
inflammatory infiltrate of neutrophils with vasculitis and/or panniculitis. 
There is deposition of immune complexes and complement together with 
Mycobacterium leprae antigens in the skin. Changes in serum levels of Igs 
indicate a transient, localised immune response. The major T-cell subtype in ENL 
is the CD4 cell, in contrast to lepromatous leprosy where CD8 cells predominate. 
The cytokines TNFalpha and IL-6 are consistently found whilst IL-4 is low or 
absent in ENL lesions, indicating a T(H)1 type response. Keratinocyte 1a and 
intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) have been shown to be present in the 
epidermis in ENL, which is evidence of a cell-mediated immune response. 
Co-stimulatory molecules such as B7-1 have also been studied but further work is 
needed to draw strong conclusions. We also highlight potential areas for future 
research.

Erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL, Type 2 reactions) complicates lepromatous and 
borderline lepromatous leprosy and can affect many organ systems, often with 
irreversible damage. The reactions commonly occur in the 2 years after starting 
treatment and often run a recurrent or chronic course, sometimes for many years. 
Even with WHO multi-drug therapy about 30% of LL patients experience ENL. We 
review drug management of ENL focussing on data from controlled trials and other 
studies. The treatment of ENL is difficult because high doses of steroids may be 
required for prolonged periods and do not always control the inflammation. The 
paradox of ENL is that it can be a life-threatening disorder and requires 
control with immunosuppression which may itself pose life-threatening risks for 
patients. Treatment with thalidomide provides an effective alternative to 
steroid therapy, gives better long-term control and avoids the adverse effects 
of prolonged steroid therapy. Controlled clinical trials have demonstrated that 
thalidomide rapidly controls ENL and is superior to aspirin and pentoxifylline. 
However, thalidomide is teratogenic when taken in early pregnancy and is 
unavailable in many leprosy endemic countries. We discuss the role of 
thalidomide in treating ENL, the complications encountered and risk reduction 
strategies that can be used. These include good patient selection and 
counselling, close supervision and adequate access to appropriate contraception. 
Further research is needed to improve the understanding and treatment of this 
severe and debilitating complication of leprosy. Topics for research include: i. 
The development of validated tools to measure the severity and/or activity of 
ENL. ii. A detailed assessment of the neurotoxic effects of thalidomide when 
used to treat ENL. iii. A well designed trial comparing thalidomide with 
prednisolone. iv. The development of a safe and effective alternative to both 
steroids and thalidomide.

Mixed phenotype acute leukemia with t(11;19)(q23;p13.3)/ MLL-MLLT1(ENL), 
B/T-lymphoid type: A first case report.

Naghashpour M, Lancet J, Moscinski L, Zhang L.

The majority of cases of acute leukemia belong to a specific lineage origin, 
either lymphoid or myeloid, and therefore are classified as acute lymphoblastic 
leukemia (ALL) or acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), based on morphologic 
features and cytochemical and immunophenotypic profile of the blast cells. A 
minority of acute leukemias however, show no clear evidence of differentiation 
along a single lineage. These are now classified under acute leukemias of 
ambiguous lineage by the most recent WHO classification and account for <4% of 
all cases of acute leukemia [1]. They include leukemias with no lineage specific 
antigens (acute undifferentiated leukemias) and those with blasts that express 
antigens of more than one lineage to such degree that it is not possible to 
assign the leukemia to any one particular lineage with certainty (mixed 
phenotype acute leukemias). The latter can either be leukemias with two distinct 
populations of blasts, each expressing antigens of a different lineage 
(historically referred to as "bilineal" leukemias) or a single blast population 
expressing antigens of multiple lineages (historically referred to as 
"biphenotypic" acute leukemias) [2]. Acute leukemias of ambiguous lineage may 
harbor a variety of genetic lesions. Those with t(9;22)(q34;q11) or 
translocations associated with mixed lineage leukemias (MLL) gene, i.e., 
t(11;V)(q23;V), occur frequently enough and are associated with distinct 
features, that are considered as separate entities according to the recent WHO 
classification. Co-expression of myeloid and B-lymphoid antigens is most common 
in mixed phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL), followed by co-expression of myeloid 
and T-lymphoid antigens, accounting for 66-70% and 23-24% of MLLs, respectively. 
Coexpression of B- and T-lineage associated antigens or antigens of all three 
lineages is exceedingly rare, accounting for <5% of MLLs [3,4]. The requirements 
for assigning more than one lineage to a single blast population has been 
established by current WHO classification [1].

Natural killer (NK) cells actively participate in anti-tumor immunity and are 
thus regarded as a promising tool in immunotherapy against esophageal cancer 
(EC). However, the mechanisms regulating NK cell activation and exhaustion have 
not been completely elucidated. In this study, we characterized the expression 
and function of MLLT1 super elongation complex subunit (MLLT1) in esophageal NK 
cells in a mouse EC model. MLLT1 was down-regulated in esophageal NK cells, 
especially NK cells expressing both T cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain 
containing-3 (TIM-3) and lymphocyte activation gene3(LAG-3). In vitro knockdown 
of MLLT1 in NK cells resulted in significant decreases in the expression of 
IFN-γ and perforin, as well as impaired NK cell cytotoxicity on tumor cells. 
Adoptive transfer of MLLT-deficient NK cells into EC-bearing mice showed 
consistent impairment of NK cell anti-tumor activity, as evidenced by decreases 
in IFN-γ and perforin but not granzyme B. Furthermore, EC tissue cells, which 
were enriched from the esophagus of EC-bearing mice, induced down-regulation of 
MLLT1 in splenic NK cells. This down-regulation was partially restored by a 
TIM-3 blocking antibody. Therefore, this study indicated that TIM-3 signaling 
down-regulated MLLT1 in esophageal NK cells, and MLLT1 down-regulation 
undermined the tumoricidal function of NK cells in EC. Our study unveils a novel 
mechanism underlying NK cell exhaustion/dysfunction in the EC microenvironment. 
MLLT1 could be a potential target in future NK cell-mediated immunotherapy 
against EC.

A systematic review on the epidemiological data of erythema nodosum leprosum, a 
type 2 leprosy reaction.

Voorend CG(1), Post EB.

BACKGROUND: Erythema Nodosum Leprosum (ENL) is a humoral immunological response 
in leprosy that leads to inflammatory skin nodules which may result in nerve and 
organ damage, and may occur years after antibiotic treatment. Multiple episodes 
are frequent and suppression requires high doses of immunosuppressive drugs. 
Global occurrence is unknown.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Systematic review of evidence on ENL incidence 
resulted in 65 papers, predominantly from India (24) and Brazil (9), and 
inclusive of four reviews. Average incidences are based on cumulative incidence 
and size of study populations (n>100). In field-based studies 653/54,737 (1.2%) 
of all leprosy cases, 194/4,279 (4.5%) of MB cases, and 86/560 (15.4%) of LL 
cases develop ENL. Some studies found a range of 1-8 per 100 
person-years-at-risk (PYAR) amongst MB cases. Hospital samples indicate that 
2,393/17,513 (13.7%) of MB cases develop ENL. Regional differences could not be 
confirmed. Multiple ENL episodes occurred in 39 to 77% of ENL patients, with an 
average of 2.6. Some studies find a peak in ENL incidence in the first year of 
treatment, others during the second and third year after starting MDT. The main 
risk factor for ENL is a high bacteriological index.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Few studies reported on ENL as a primary outcome, and 
definitions of ENL differed between studies. Although, in this review averages 
are presented, accurate data on global and regional ENL incidence is lacking. 
Large prospective studies or accurate surveillance data would be required to 
clarify this. Health staff needs to be aware of late reactions, as new ENL may 
develop as late as five years after MDT completion, and recurrences up to 8 
years afterwards.

The Ten Eleven Translocation 1 (TET1) gene encodes an epigenetic modifying 
molecule that is involved in demethylation of 5-methylcytosine. In hematological 
malignancies, loss-of-function mutations of TET2, which is one of the TET family 
genes including TET1, are frequently found, while the mutations of TET1 are not. 
However, clinical studies have revealed that TET1 is highly expressed in some 
cases of the hematological malignancies including acute myeloid leukemia. 
Indeed, studies by mouse models using conventional Tet1 knockout mice 
demonstrated that Tet1 is involved in myeloid leukemogenesis by Mixed Lineage 
Leukemia (MLL) fusion gene or TET2 mutant. Meanwhile, the other study showed 
that Tet1 is highly expressed in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), and that 
deletion of Tet1 in HSCs enhances potential self-renewal capacity, which is 
potentially associated with myeloid leukemogenesis. To examine the role of Tet1 
in myeloid leukemogenesis more precisely, we generated novel conditional 
Tet1-knockout mice, which were used to generate the compound mutant mice by 
crossing with the inducible MLL-ENL transgenic mice that we developed 
previously. The leukemic immortalization in vitro was not critically affected by 
conditional ablation of Tet1 in HSCs with the induced expression of MLL-ENL or 
in hematopoietic progenitor cells retrovirally transduced with MLL-ENL. In 
addition, the leukemic phenotypes caused by the induced expression of MLL-ENL in 
vivo was not also critically affected in the compound mutant mouse model by 
conditional ablation of Tet1, although we found that the expression of Evi1, 
which is one of critical target genes of MLL fusion gene, in tumor cells was 
remarkably low under Tet1-ablated condition. These results revealed that Tet1 
was dispensable for the myeloid leukemogenesis by MLL-ENL, suggesting that the 
therapeutic application of Tet1 inhibition may need careful assessment.

Both MLL-AF9 and MLL-ENL leukemia fusion proteins drive oncogenic transformation 
of hematopoietic cells through their N-terminal DNA/histone binding 
mixed-lineage leukemia 1 domain and C-terminal fragment of AF9 or ENL containing 
an unstructured linker region and the ANC1 homology domain, which recruits 
transcription factors. Despite of their structural similarity, acute myeloid 
leukemia (AML) patients bearing MLL-ENL show more adverse outcomes compared to 
those with MLL-AF9. We recapitulated the clinical patterns of these two 
MLL-fusions driven AMLs using murine models and found that MLL-ENL AML cells 
showed slower cell cycle progression and more resistance to standard 
chemotherapy than MLL-AF9 cells. These phenotypes were primarily controlled by 
the linker regions of ENL and a highly conserved lysine residue K469 within. 
Substitution of K469 with an acetylated mimic glutamine abolished the ability of 
MLL-ENL to suppress proliferation and promote chemo-resistance. We showed that 
deacetylase Sirt2 might act as an upstream regulator of MLL-ENL. Deletion of 
Sirt2 promoted proliferation of AML cells with either MLL fusions. Importantly, 
loss of Sirt2 greatly enhanced the sensitivity of the MLL-ENL AML cells to 
chemo-treatment. Taken together, our study uncovered a unique regulatory role of 
Sirt2 in leukemogenesis and suggested targeting SIRT2 as a new way to sensitize 
MLL-ENL AML patience for chemotherapy.

YEATS-domain-containing MLLT1 is an acetyl/acyl-lysine reader domain, which is 
structurally distinct from well-studied bromodomains and has been strongly 
associated in development of cancer. Here, we characterized piperazine-urea 
derivatives as an acetyl/acyl-lysine mimetic moiety for MLLT1. Crystal 
structures revealed distinct interaction mechanisms of this chemotype compared 
to the recently described benzimidazole-amide based inhibitors, exploiting 
different binding pockets within the protein. Thus, the piperazine-urea scaffold 
offers an alternative strategy for targeting the YEATS domain family.

Leprosy is a disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae where the clinical spectrum 
correlates with the patient immune response. Erythema Nodosum Leprosum (ENL) is 
an immune-mediated inflammatory complication, which causes significant morbidity 
in affected leprosy patients. The underlying cause of ENL is not conclusively 
known. However, immune-complexes and cell-mediated immunity have been suggested 
in the pathogenesis of ENL. The aim of this study was to investigate the 
regulatory T-cells in patients with ENL. Forty-six untreated patients with ENL 
and 31 non-reactional lepromatous leprosy (LL) patient controls visiting ALERT 
Hospital, Ethiopia were enrolled to the study. Blood samples were obtained 
before, during and after prednisolone treatment of ENL cases. Peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated and used for immunophenotyping of 
regulatory T-cells by flow cytometry. Five markers: CD3, CD4 or CD8, CD25, CD27 
and FoxP3 were used to define CD4+ and CD8+ regulatory T-cells. Clinical and 
histopathological data were obtained as supplementary information. All patients 
had been followed for 28 weeks. Patients with ENL reactions had a lower 
percentage of CD4+ regulatory T-cells (1.7%) than LL patient controls (3.8%) at 
diagnosis of ENL before treatment. After treatment, the percentage of 
CD4+regulatory T-cells was not significantly different between the two groups. 
The percentage of CD8+ regulatory T-cells was not significantly different in ENL 
and LL controls before and after treatment. Furthermore, patients with ENL had 
higher percentage of CD4+ T-ells and CD4+/CD8+ T-cells ratio than LL patient 
controls before treatment. The expression of CD25 on CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells was 
not significantly different in ENL and LL controls suggesting that CD25 
expression is not associated with ENL reactions while FoxP3 expression on CD4+ 
T-cells was significantly lower in patients with ENL than in LL controls. We 
also found that prednisolone treatment of patients with ENL reactions suppresses 
CD4+ T-cell but not CD8+ T-cell frequencies. Hence, ENL is associated with lower 
levels of T regulatory cells and higher CD4+/CD8+ T-cell ratio. We suggest that 
this loss of regulation is one of the causes of ENL.

BACKGROUND: Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a subtype of stroke and causes 
disability and death worldwide. The roles of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in 
brain function and neurological diseases have been revealed. LncRNA maternally 
expressed gene 3 (MEG3) is involved in neurological impairment, but its role in 
ICH remains unknown.
AIMS: The aim of this research is to explore the role of MEG3 in ICH.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Here, we established an ICH mouse model via intracerebral 
injection of autologous blood. Primary brain microvascular endothelial cells 
(BMECs) were treated with oxygen-and-glucose-deprivation (OGD) plus hemin to 
establish the model in vitro. We observed that MEG3 expression was significantly 
upregulated in both ICH mouse model and OGD/hemin (OGD/H) induced BMECs. The 
downregulation of MEG3 suppressed cell apoptosis and the activation of NOD-like 
receptor family protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome in OGD/H-induced BMECs. In ICH 
mice, MEG3 downregulation inhibited cell apoptosis and improved brain 
dysfunction. Mechanistically, MEG3 was confirmed to act as a molecular sponge 
for microRNA (miR)-1930-5p, and Mllt1 was a downstream target for miR-1930-5p. 
MEG3 competitively bound with miR-1930-5p to upregulate Mllt1. We further 
verified that Mllt1 overexpression reversed the inhibitory effect of miR-1930-5p 
in OGD/H-induced BMECs.
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, lncRNA MEG3 promoted the dysfunction of BMECs by 
modulating the miR-1930-5p/Mllt1 axis, which provides a potential target in gene 
therapy for brain injury following ICH.

Erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) occurs as an immune-inflammatory complication of 
multibacillary leprosy (MBL), precipitated by an interaction between the host, 
bacilli, and the environment. This complication often causes significant 
morbidity due to systemic involvement and needs to be treated aggressively. 
T-regulatory cells (T-regs) are the immunomodulatory subset of T cells that are 
hypothesized to play a role in ENL. We have performed immunohistochemistry for 
FoxP3 (T-reg), CD3 (pan-T), CD4 (helper T), and CD8 (cytotoxic T) on 50 
biopsy-proven cases of ENL along with 84 biopsy-proven cases of paucibacillary 
leprosy (PBL) (n = 49) and MBL (n = 35). Image morphometry was applied to 
objectively assess the relative preponderance of these subsets of T cells. The 
area fraction of T-regs showed a trend of reduction from PBL to MBL to ENL (P = 
0.068), whereas the FoxP3:CD3 (T-reg: pan-T) ratio showed a significant 
reduction across these groups (P = 0.023). However, there was no significant 
difference of T-regs or FoxP3:CD3 ratio between MBL and ENL. The T-regs showed a 
significant positive correlation (P = 0.007) with the cytotoxic T cells in the 
skin biopsy. The presence of dermal eosinophils in ENL showed a trend 
association with the FoxP3:CD3 ratio (P = 0.05). Various histopathological 
parameters including epidermal spongiosis, dermal stromal edema, dermal 
ill-formed granuloma, and the presence of bacilli within the endothelium and 
vascular smooth muscle correlated with various T-cell subsets. Our study, one of 
the largest on this topic, objectively assessed the role of T-regs in the 
spectrum of leprosy. Nevertheless, the precipitation of ENL from MBL is probably 
not associated with the T-reg subset alone.

A New Complex Karyotype Involving a KMT2A-r Variant Three-Way Translocation in a 
Rare Clinical Presentation of a Pediatric Patient with Acute Myeloid Leukemia.

Patients with childhood acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with complex karyotypes 
(CKs) have a dismal outcome. However, for patients with a KMT2A rearrangement 
(KMT2A-r), the prognosis appears to depend on the fusion partner gene rather 
than the karyotype structure. Thus, a precise characterization of KMT2A-r and 
the fusion partner genes, especially in CKs, is of interest for managing AML. We 
describe the clinical and molecular features of a child who presented with a 
large abdominal mass, AML, and a new CK, involving chromosomes 11, 16, and 19 
leading to a KMT2A-MLLT1 fusion and 2 extra copies of the ELL gene, thus 
resulting in the concurrent overexpression of MLLT1 and ELL. Molecular 
cytogenetic studies defined the karyotype as 
47,XY,der(11)t(11;16)(q23.3;p11.2),der(16)t(16;19)(p11.2;p13.3),der(19)t(11;19)(q23.3;p13.3),+der(19)t(16;19)(16pter→p11.2::19p13.3→19q11::19p11→19p13.3::16p11.2→16pter). 
Array CGH revealed a gain of 30.5 Mb in the 16p13.3p11.2 region and a gain of 
18.1 Mb in the 19p13.3p12 region. LDI-PCR demonstrated the KMT2A-MLLT1 fusion. 
Reverse sequence analysis showed that the MLLT1 gene was fused to the 16p11.2 
region. RT-qPCR quantification revealed that ELL and MLLT1 were overexpressed 
(4- and 10-fold, respectively). In summary, this is a pediatric case of AML 
presenting a novel complex t(11;16;19) variant with overexpression of ELL and 
MLLT1.

MLL rearrangements are translocation mutations that cause both acute 
lymphoblastic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). These translocations 
can occur as sole clonal driver mutations in infant leukemias, suggesting that 
fetal or neonatal hematopoietic progenitors may be exquisitely sensitive to 
transformation by MLL fusion proteins. To test this possibility, we used 
transgenic mice to induce one translocation product, MLL-ENL, during fetal, 
neonatal, juvenile and adult stages of life. When MLL-ENL was induced in fetal 
or neonatal mice, almost all died of AML. In contrast, when MLL-ENL was induced 
in adult mice, most survived for >1 year despite sustained transgene expression. 
AML initiation was most efficient when MLL-ENL was induced in neonates, and even 
transient suppression of MLL-ENL in neonates could prevent AML in most mice. 
MLL-ENL target genes were induced more efficiently in neonatal progenitors than 
in adult progenitors, consistent with the distinct AML initiation efficiencies. 
Interestingly, transplantation stress mitigated the developmental barrier to 
leukemogenesis. Since fetal/neonatal progenitors were highly competent to 
initiate MLL-ENL-driven AML, we tested whether Lin28b, a fetal master regulator, 
could accelerate leukemogenesis. Surprisingly, Lin28b suppressed AML initiation 
rather than accelerating it. This may explain why MLL rearrangements often occur 
before birth in human infant leukemia patients, but transformation usually does 
not occur until after birth, when Lin28b levels decline. Our findings show that 
the efficiency of MLL-ENL-driven AML initiation changes through the course of 
pre- and postnatal development, and developmental programs can be manipulated to 
impede transformation.

About 25% of the patients with the translocation t(11;19)(q23;p13.3)/KMT2A-MLLT1 
present three-way or more complex fusions, associated with a worse prognosis, 
suggesting that a particular mechanism creates functional KMT2A fusions for this 
condition. In this work, we show a cryptic three-way translocation t(9;11;19). 
Interestingly, long-distance inverse polymerase chain reaction sequencing 
revealed a KMT2A-MLLT1 and the yet unreported out-of-frame SEC16A-KMT2A fusion, 
associated with low SEC16A expression and KMT2A overexpression, in an infant 
with B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia presenting a poor prognosis. Our case 
illustrates the importance of molecular cytogenetic tests in selecting cases for 
further investigations, which could open perspectives regarding novel 
therapeutic approaches for poor prognosis childhood leukemias.

Chromosomal rearrangements of the mixed-lineage leukemia gene MLL1 are the 
hallmark of infant acute leukemia. The granulocyte-macrophage progenitor state 
forms the epigenetic basis for myelomonocytic leukemia stemness and 
transformation by MLL-type oncoproteins. Previously, it was shown that the 
establishment of murine myelomonocytic MLL-ENL transformation, but not its 
maintenance, depends on the transcription factor C/EBPα, suggesting an 
epigenetic hit-and-run mechanism of MLL-driven oncogenesis. Here, we demonstrate 
that compound deletion of Cebpa/Cebpb almost entirely abrogated the growth and 
survival of MLL-ENL-transformed cells. Rare, slow-growing, and apoptosis-prone 
MLL-ENL-transformed escapees were recovered from compound Cebpa/Cebpb deletions. 
The escapees were uniformly characterized by high expression of the resident 
Cebpe gene, suggesting inferior functional compensation of C/EBPα/C/EBPβ 
deficiency by C/EBPε. Complementation was augmented by ectopic C/EBPβ expression 
and downstream activation of IGF1 that enhanced growth. Cebpe gene inactivation 
was accomplished only in the presence of complementing C/EBPβ, but not in its 
absence, confirming the Cebpe dependency of the Cebpa/Cebpb double knockouts. 
Our data show that MLL-transformed myeloid cells are dependent on C/EBPs during 
the initiation and maintenance of transformation.

Complement C1q is a soluble protein capable of initiating components of the 
classical pathway in host defence system. In earlier qualitative studies, C1q 
has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Erythema Nodosum Leprosum (ENL). 
However, little is known about the role of this complement in ENL reaction. In 
the present study we described the protein level of C1q production and its gene 
expression in the peripheral blood and skin biopsies in patients with ENL 
reaction and lepromatous leprosy (LL) patient controls before and after 
treatment. Thirty untreated patients with ENL reaction and 30 non-reactional LL 
patient controls were recruited at ALERT Hospital, Ethiopia. Peripheral blood 
and skin biopsies were obtained from each patient before and after treatment. 
The level of circulating C1q in the plasma was determined by enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay. The mRNA expression of the three C1q components, C1qA, 
C1qB, and C1qC in the peripheral blood and skin biopsies was determined by qPCR. 
Circulating C1q in the peripheral blood of untreated ENL patients was 
significantly decreased compared to LL patient controls. Untreated ENL patients 
had increased C1q gene expression in the peripheral blood compared to LL 
controls. Similarly, C1qA and C1qC gene expression were substantially increased 
in the skin biopsies of untreated ENL patients compared to LL controls. However, 
after treatment none of these genes show significant difference in both groups. 
In conclusion, while circulating C1q is inversely correlated with active ENL 
reactions, its gene expression is directly correlated with ENL. The decreased 
circulating C1q may suggest the utilization of C1q in immune-complex formation 
in these patients. Therefore, C1q could be a potential diagnostic marker for 
active ENL reactions as well as for monitoring ENL treatment.

BACKGROUND: Erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) is a common immune-mediated 
complication of lepromatous (LL) and borderline lepromatous (BL) leprosy. Most 
patients experience chronic or multiple acute ENL over many years during an 
economically active period of their lives. Understanding the economic burden of 
ENL is essential to provide effective patient support, yet this area has not 
been investigated.
METHODS: Ninety-one patients with LL or BL leprosy attending a leprosy hospital 
in Purulia district of West Bengal, India, were interviewed using a structured 
questionnaire. Cases (n = 53) were identified as those who had one or more 
episodes of ENL within the last 3 years. Controls (n = 38) had LL or BL leprosy 
but no history of ENL. Data were collected on household income, direct and 
indirect costs, and coping strategies.
FINDINGS: The total household cost was Rs 1543 per month or 27.9% (IQR 
13.2-52.6) of monthly household income for cases, and Rs 237 per month or 4.9% 
(IQR 1.7-13.4) of monthly household income for controls. Indirect costs 
accounted for 65% of total household costs for cases. Direct costs accounted for 
the remaining 35% of household costs, and resulted almost entirely from 
treatment-seeking in the private sector. Total household costs exceeded 40% of 
household income for 37.7% of cases (n = 20) and 2.6% of controls (n = 1) [1 USD 
= 59 INR].
INTERPRETATION: Households affected by ENL face significant economic burden and 
are at risk of being pushed further into poverty. Health policy should 
acknowledge the importance of private sector provision and the significant 
contribution to total household costs of lost productivity (indirect cost). 
Further work is needed to explore this area and identify solutions.

Erythema Nodosum Leprosum (ENL) is a recurrent acute inflammatory complication 
of leprosy affecting up to 50% of all Borderline Lepromatous and Lepromatous 
Leprosy (BL/LL) patients. Although ENL is described as an immune reaction 
mediated by neutrophils, studies demonstrating the direct role of neutrophils in 
ENL are still rare. One subpopulation of low-density neutrophils (LDNs), present 
within the fraction of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), has been 
associated with the pathogenesis and severity of diseases like sepsis, lupus, 
and tuberculosis. We herein analyzed LDNs and high-density neutrophils (HDNs) in 
terms of frequency, phenotype, and morphology. Serum levels of MMP-9 (a 
neutrophilic degranulation marker) were evaluated by ELISA; and LDNs were 
generated in vitro by stimulating healthy-donor, whole-blood cultures. PBMC 
layers of ENL patients presented segmented/hypersegmented cells that were 
morphologically compatible with neutrophils. Immunofluorescence analyses 
identified LDNs in ENL. Flow cytometry confirmed the elevated frequency of 
circulating LDNs (CD14-CD15+) in ENL patients compared to healthy donors and 
nonreactional Borderline Tuberculoid (BT) patients. Moreover, flow cytometry 
analyses revealed that ENL LDNs had a neutrophilic-activated phenotype. ENL 
patients under thalidomide treatment presented similar frequency of LDNs as 
observed before treatment but its activation status was lower. In addition, 
Mycobacterium leprae induced in vitro generation of LDNs in whole blood in a 
dose-dependent fashion; and TGF-β, an inhibitor of neutrophilic degranulation, 
prevented LDNs generation. MMP-9 serum levels of BL/LL patients with or without 
ENL correlated with LDNs frequency at the same time that ultrastructural 
observations of ENL LDNs showed suggestive signs of degranulation. Together, our 
data provide new insights into the knowledge and understanding of the 
pathogenesis of ENL while enriching the role of neutrophils in leprosy.

function.

BACKGROUND: The numbers of circulating regulatory T cells (Tregs) are increased 
in lepromatous leprosy (LL) but reduced in erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL), the 
inflammatory complication of LL. It is unclear whether the suppressive function 
of Tregs is intact in both these conditions.
METHODS: A longitudinal study recruited participants at ALERT Hospital, 
Ethiopia. Peripheral blood samples were obtained before and after 24 weeks of 
prednisolone treatment for ENL and multidrug therapy (MDT) for participants with 
LL. We evaluated the suppressive function of Tregs in the peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of participants with LL and ENL by analysis of TNFα, 
IFNγ and IL-10 responses to Mycobacterium leprae (M. leprae) stimulation before 
and after depletion of CD25+ cells.
RESULTS: 30 LL participants with ENL and 30 LL participants without ENL were 
recruited. The depletion of CD25+ cells from PBMCs was associated with enhanced 
TNFα and IFNγ responses to M. leprae stimulation before and after 24 weeks 
treatment of LL with MDT and of ENL with prednisolone. The addition of 
autologous CD25+ cells to CD25+ depleted PBMCs abolished these responses. In 
both non-reactional LL and ENL groups mitogen (PHA)-induced TNFα and IFNγ 
responses were not affected by depletion of CD25+ cells either before or after 
treatment. Depleting CD25+ cells did not affect the IL-10 response to M. leprae 
before and after 24 weeks of MDT in participants with LL. However, depletion of 
CD25+ cells was associated with an enhanced IL-10 response on stimulation with 
M. leprae in untreated participants with ENL and reduced IL-10 responses in 
treated individuals with ENL. The enhanced IL-10 in untreated ENL and the 
reduced IL-10 response in prednisolone treated individuals with ENL was 
abolished by addition of autologous CD25+ cells.
CONCLUSION: The findings support the hypothesis that the impaired cell-mediated 
immune response in individuals with LL is M. leprae antigen specific and the 
unresponsiveness can be reversed by depleting CD25+ cells. Our results suggest 
that the suppressive function of Tregs in ENL is intact despite ENL being 
associated with reduced numbers of Tregs. The lack of difference in IL-10 
response in control PBMCs and CD25+ depleted PBMCs in individuals with LL and 
the increased IL-10 response following the depletion of CD25+ cells in 
individuals with untreated ENL suggest that the mechanism of immune regulation 
by Tregs in leprosy appears independent of IL-10 or that other cells may be 
responsible for IL-10 production in leprosy. The present findings highlight 
mechanisms of T cell regulation in LL and ENL and provide insights into the 
control of peripheral immune tolerance, identifying Tregs as a potential 
therapeutic target.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to assess the efficacy and safety 
profiles of combined treatment of prednisolone with thalidomide (Gr-A) and 
prednisolone with clofazimine (Gr. B) in patients with erythema nodosum leprosum 
(ENL) or type 2 lepra reactions.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Efficacy of both regimens was assessed on the basis of 
clinical recovery of recurrent ENL measured by reaction severity score (RSS), 
Visual Analog Scale (VAS), and recurrence of type 2 lepra reaction. The 
causality assessment of adverse drug reactions was done using the WHO UMC 
causality assessment scale.
RESULTS: The average age of patients with recurrent ENL was 42.8 years (male) 
and 51.8yrs (female) and had mean duration of leprosy and recurrent ENL 2.4 
years and 2.09 years, respectively. 80% of nonrecurrence was observed in Gr-A 
versus 66% in Gr-B. Significant (P < 0.05) lower RSS and VAS was found in both 
the treatment groups as compared to pretreatment value. The reduction in RSS and 
VAS was statistically significant (P < 0.05) in Gr-A compared to Gr-B treatment.
CONCLUSION: Thalidomide combination with steroid was found to be more 
efficacious than clofazimine combination with steroid in the treatment of ENL 
both the treatment regimens showed few tolerable side effects. Improved 
strategies for the treatment and management of these reactions need to be 
developed.

Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) is a rare hematologic 
malignancy characterized by CD4 and CD56 coexpression without apparent lineage 
commitment. The molecular pathogenesis of BPDCN has been studied in only a 
limited number of cases, and specific chromosomal aberrations are lacking thus 
far. KMT2A (MLL) rearrangements are observed in various types of pediatric and 
adult leukemia, but only one adult case report has so far showed KMT2A 
(MLL)-MLLT1 gene rearrangements in BPDCN. We present the first pediatric case of 
BPDCN with a KMT2A (MLL)-MLLT1 rearrangement confirmed by molecular study. The 
karyotype demonstrated a t(11;19)(q23;p13.3), trisomy 8, and trisomy 19 in all 
20 metaphase cells analyzed: 48,XX,+8,t(11;19)(q23;p13.3),+19[20]. Fluorescence 
in situ hybridization analysis showed KMT2A (MLL) gene rearrangement in 83% of 
interphase cells. The KMT2A (MLL)-MLLT1 gene rearrangement was confirmed by 
multiplex reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. We suggest that the 
pathogenesis of BPDCN could be associated with KMT2A (MLL) rearrangement 
(especially with KMT2A (MLL)-MLLT1) and further study on a larger number of 
cases is needed.

Thalidomide and its impact in dermatology.

Stirling DI(1).

Author information:
(1)Celgene Corporation, Warren, NJ 07059, USA.

Thalidomide, originally marketed as a sedative, was introduced in West Germany 
in 1956 and in numerous other countries soon thereafter. In part because it did 
not impair coordination or respiratory function, the drug rapidly became 
extremely popular. By 1961, however, there were mounting reports of phocomelia 
and other severe congenital abnormalities associated with maternal use of 
thalidomide, and the drug was withdrawn from the market and its availability 
highly restricted. A few years later, thalidomide would find use in dermatology 
after it was reported that leprosy patients with erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) 
experienced rapid and dramatic improvement after taking the drug as a sedative. 
Additional data quickly confirmed thalidomide's efficacy in ENL, and today it is 
the drug of choice in the condition. In subsequent decades, the drug has been 
successfully tried in treatment of a variety of apparently unrelated 
dermatologic disorders. Meanwhile, thalidomide has been shown to possess a range 
of biologic actions, including inhibition of tumor necrosis factor alpha, 
possibly relevant to its clinical efficacy. Dermatologic disorders in addition 
to ENL in which thalidomide's effectiveness is well documented include aphthous 
stomatitis, discoid lupus erythematosus, actinic prurigo, Behçet's disease, and 
prurigo nodularis. More recently, the drug has been employed in dermatologic 
conditions associated with HIV infection. When used with safeguards to prevent 
teratogenicity and the drug's other major adverse effect, peripheral neuropathy, 
thalidomide may offer a good therapeutic option for many patients in whom other 
drug therapies have proven inadequate.

Mammalian phytoestrogens: enterodiol and enterolactone.

The mammalian phytoestrogens enterodiol (END) and enterolactone (ENL) are 
produced in the colon by the action of bacteria on the plant precursors 
matairesinol (MAT), secoisolariciresinol (SECO), their glycosides, and other 
precursors in the diet. Both END and ENL have been shown to possess weakly 
estrogenic and antiestrogenic activities, and it has been suggested that the 
high production of these antiestrogenic mammalian lignans in the gut may serve 
to protect against breast cancer in women and prostate cancer in men. Various in 
vitro experiments suggested END and ENL significantly inhibited the growth of 
human colon tumor cells, and the E2-induced proliferation of MCF-7 breast cancer 
cells was inhibited by ENL. The protective effects of mammalian lignans may be 
due to their ability to compete with E2 for the type II estrogen receptor, to 
induce sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), to inhibit placental aromatase, and 
to act as antioxidants. This review mainly deals with the chemistry, 
quantitative analysis, biological properties and health effects of END and ENL.

Thalidomide for erythema nodosum leprosum and other applications.

Okafor MC(1).

Author information:

USA.

Thalidomide, administered as a sedative and antiemetic decades ago, was 
considered responsible for numerous devastating cases of birth defects and 
consequently was banned from markets worldwide. However, the drug remarkably has 
resurfaced with promise of immunomodulatory benefit in a wide array of 
immunologic disorders for which available treatments were limited. It is 
approved by the Food and Drug Administration for erythema nodosum leprosum 
(ENL). Although the relative paucity of leprosy and ENL worldwide may 
perceivably limit interest in and knowledge about thalidomide, increasing 
numbers of new and potential uses expand its applicability widely beyond ENL. 
Thalidomide, an inhibitor of tumor necrosis factor a, is the best known agent 
for short-term treatment of ENL skin manifestations, as well as postremission 
maintenance therapy to prevent recurrence. For this indication, it is effective 
as monotherapy and as part of combination therapy with corticosteroids. Studies 
of thalidomide in chronic graft-versus-host disease showed benefit in children 
and adults as treatment, but not as prophylaxis. The agent has been administered 
successfully for treatment of cachexia related to cancer, tuberculosis, and 
human immunodeficiency virus infection, although evidence of efficacy is 
inconclusive. Thalidomide monotherapy effectively induced objective response in 
trials in patients with both newly diagnosed and advanced or refractory multiple 
myeloma. Combination therapy with thalidomide and corticosteroids was also 
effective in these patients, as well as in treatment of aphthous and genital 
ulcers. Limited evidence supports the drug's benefit in treatment of Kaposi's 
sarcoma. Other thalidomide applications include Crohn's disease, rheumatoid 
arthritis, and multiple sclerosis. Somnolence, constipation, and rash were the 
most frequently cited adverse effects in studies, but thalidomide-induced 
neuropathy and idiopathic thromboembolism were critical causes for drug 
discontinuation. Thalidomide is still contraindicated in pregnant women, women 
of childbearing age, and sexually active men not using contraception. Clinicians 
should be conversant with thalidomide in ENL (its primary application) in the 
natural course of leprosy, as well as in the agent's other applications.

BACKGROUND: Ovarian cancer is one of the three leading gynecological 
malignancies, characterized by insidious growth, highly frequent metastasis, and 
quick development of drug resistance. As a result, this disease has low 5-year 
survival rates. Estrogen receptor inhibitors were commonly used for the 
treatment, but only 7% to 18% of patients respond to anti-estrogen therapies. 
Therefore, more effective therapies to inhibit estrogen-related tumors are 
urgently needed. Recently, phytoestrogens, such as lignans with estrogen-like 
biological activities, have attracted attention for their potential effects in 
the prevention or treatment of estrogen-related diseases. Enterodiol (END) and 
enterolactone (ENL) are mammalian lignans, which can reduce the risk of various 
cancers. However, the effects of END and ENL on ovarian cancer are not 
adequately documented.
METHODS: We used in vitro assays on the ES-2 cell line to evaluate the 
inhibiting effects of END and ENL on ovarian cancer cell proliferation, invasion 
and migration ability and in vivo xenograft experiments on nude mice to validate 
the anticancer effects of END and ENL.
RESULTS: The in vitro assays demonstrated that high-dose END and ENL could 
obviously inhibit ovarian malignant properties, including cancerous 
proliferation, invasion, and metastasis. Compared to END, ENL behaved in a 
better time-dose dependent manner on the cancer cells. The in vivo experiments 
showed that END (1 mg/kg), ENL (1 mg/kg) and ENL (0.1 mg/kg) suppressed tumor 
markedly, and there were statistically significant differences between the 
experimental and control groups in tumor weight and volume. Compared to END, 
which have serious side effects to the animals at high concentration such as 
1 mg/kg, ENL had higher anticancer activities and less side effects in the 
animals than END at the same concentrations, so it would be a better candidate 
for drug development.
CONCLUSION: END and ENL both have potent inhibitory effects on ovarian cancer 
but ENL possesses a more effective anti-cancer capability and less side effects 
than END. Findings in this work provide novel insights into ovarian cancer 
therapeutics with phytoestrogens and encourage their clinical applications.

BACKGROUND: Leprosy is a treatable infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium 
leprae. However, there is additional morbidity from leprosy-associated 
pathologic immune reactions, reversal reaction (RR) and erythema nodosum 
leprosum (ENL), which occur in 1 in 3 people with leprosy, even with effective 
treatment of M. leprae. There is currently no predictive marker in use to 
indicate which people with leprosy will develop these debilitating immune 
reactions. Our peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) transcriptome analysis 
revealed that activation of the classical complement pathway is common to both 
RR and ENL. Additionally, differential expression of immunoglobulin receptors 
and B cell receptors during RR and ENL support a role for the antibody-mediated 
immune response during both RR and ENL. In this study, we investigated B-cell 
immunophenotypes, total and M. leprae-specific antibodies, and complement levels 
in leprosy patients with and without RR or ENL. The objective was to determine 
the role of these immune mediators in pathogenesis and assess their potential as 
biomarkers of risk for immune reactions in people with leprosy.
METHODOLOGY/FINDINGS: We followed newly diagnosed leprosy cases (n = 96) for two 
years for development of RR or ENL. They were compared with active RR (n = 35), 
active ENL (n = 29), and healthy household contacts (n = 14). People with 
leprosy who subsequently developed ENL had increased IgM, IgG1, and 
C3d-associated immune complexes with decreased complement 4 (C4) at leprosy 
diagnosis. People who developed RR also had decreased C4 at leprosy diagnosis. 
Additionally, elevated anti-M. leprae antibody levels were associated with 
subsequent RR or ENL.
CONCLUSIONS: Differential co-receptor expression and immunoglobulin levels 
before and during immune reactions intimate a central role for humoral immunity 
in RR and ENL. Decreased C4 and elevated anti-M. leprae antibodies in people 
with new diagnosis of leprosy may be risk factors for subsequent development of 
leprosy immune reactions.

BACKGROUND: Erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) is a frequent complication of 
multibacillary leprosy that can result in significant morbidity, including 
peripheral nerve damage and physical disability. The identification of possible 
serum markers could be a valuable tool for the early detection of ENL.
AIMS: The purpose of this study was to evaluate selected serum mediators 
involved in the innate and adaptive immune responses to identify possible 
immunomarkers for ENL.
METHODS: The levels of interleukin-2, interleukin-4, interleukin-6, 
interleukin-10, interleukin-17, interferon-γ, tumor necrosis factor, nitric 
oxide and anti-phenolic glycolipid-I antibodies were measured in the sera of 
leprosy patients with ENL [at the beginning of reaction (M0) and 1 month later 
(M1)], and then compared with the levels of the same markers in patients with 
untreated multibacillary leprosy without ENL (controls with leprosy: CTRL) and 
healthy individuals (healthy controls: CTRH).
RESULTS: Significantly higher levels of serum interleukin-6 were observed in M0 
than in CTRL. In addition, pairwise comparisons showed higher levels of 
interleukin-6 in M0 compared to M1. Levels of tumor necrosis factor were higher 
in M0 than in CTRL, with no significant difference between M0 and M1. There were 
no differences in the levels of interleukin-2, interleukin-4, interleukin-10, 
interleukin-17 or interferon-γ between groups. The CTRL group had higher levels 
of nitric oxide compared to M0 and M1. High levels of anti-phenolic glycolipid-I 
were observed in M0, M1 and CTRL than in CTRH.
LIMITATIONS: Three patients were not assessed at M1, decreasing the number of 
evaluated patients from 14 to 11.
CONCLUSION: High-serum levels of interleukin-6 were observed during ENL, 
primarily in patients with more severe reactions; levels decreased after 
specific therapy, suggesting a role for this cytokine in pathogenesis and its 
utility as an ENL biomarker. Further studies should explore whether 
interleukin-6 could also be used as a predictive marker for ENL or as a specific 
target for its treatment.

Previous retroviral and knock-in approaches to model human t(11;19)+ acute 
mixed-lineage leukemia in mice resulted in myeloproliferation and acute myeloid 
leukemia not fully recapitulating the human disease. The authors established a 
doxycycline (DOX)-inducible transgenic mouse model "iMLL-ENL" in which induction 
in long-term hematopoietic stem cells, lymphoid primed multipotent progenitor 
cells, multipotent progenitors (MPP4) but not in more committed myeloid 
granulocyte-macrophage progenitors led to a fully reversible acute leukemia 
expressing myeloid and B-cell markers. iMLL-ENL leukemic cells generally 
expressed lower MLL-ENL mRNA than those obtained after retroviral transduction. 
Disease induction was associated with iMLL-ENL levels exceeding the endogenous 
Mll1 at mRNA and protein levels. In leukemic cells from t(11;19)+ leukemia 
patients, MLL-ENL mRNA also exceeded the endogenous MLL1 levels suggesting a 
critical threshold for transformation. Expression profiling of iMLL-ENL acute 
leukemia revealed gene signatures that segregated t(11;19)+ leukemia patients 
from those without an MLL translocation. Importantly, B220+ iMLL-ENL leukemic 
cells showed a higher in vivo leukemia initiation potential than coexisting 
B220- cells. Collectively, characterization of a novel transgenic mouse model 
indicates that the cell-of-origin and the fusion gene expression levels are both 
critical determinants for MLL-ENL-driven acute leukemia.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of 1 μmol/L zearalenone (ZEN) 
and 1 μmol/L enterolactone (ENL), alone or in combination, on the survival and 
morphology of in vitro cultured ovarian preantral follicles. Ovaries from 10 
sheep were collected at a local abattoir and fragmented, and the ovarian pieces 
were submitted to in vitro culture for 3 days in the presence or absence of the 
test compounds. The morphology of primordial and primary follicles was impaired 
by ZEN, whereas that of cultured secondary follicles was improved by ENL. 
However, the combination of ENL with ZEN impaired the quality of primary and 
secondary follicles. Both ZEN and ENL induced apoptosis, but only ZEN was 
responsible for oocyte autophagy. None of these xenoestrogens affected 
endoplasmic reticulum stress as observed by the unaltered expression of ERP29. 
Differently from ZEN, ENL increased the expression of the efflux transporter 
ABCG2. In conclusion, although ENL can counteract the negative effects of ZEN on 
primordial and primary follicles, this positive effect is not similar to that 
observed in ovarian tissue cultures in the presence of ENL alone.

Leprosy is a chronic infection of the skin and nerves caused by Mycobacterium 
leprae. Erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) is a reactive state in lepromatous 
leprosy. Thalidomide has been used to treat ENL since the 1960s. One of its 
mechanisms of action is anti-inflammatory through selective inhibition of the 
pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha produced by monocytes.

BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a heterogeneous CNS neoplasm which 
causes significant morbidity and mortality. One reason for the poor prognostic 
outcome of GBM is attributed to the presence of cancer stem cells (CSC) which 
confer resistance against standard chemo- and radiotherapeutics modalities. Two 
types of GBM-associated CSC were isolated from the same patient: tumor core- 
(c-CSC) and peritumor tissue-derived cancer stem cells (p-CSC). Our experiments 
are focused on glioblastoma-IDH-wild type, and no disease-defining alterations 
were present in histone, BRAF or other genes.
METHODS: In the present study, potential differences in genetic variants between 
c-CSC versus p-CSC derived from four GBM patients were investigated with the 
aims of (1) comparing the exome sequences between all the c-CSC or p-CSC to 
identify the common variants; (2) identifying the variants affecting the 
function of genes known to be involved in cancer origin and development.
RESULTS: By comparative analyses, we identified common gene single nucleotide 
variants (SNV) in all GBM c-CSC and p-CSC, a potentially deleterious variant was 
a frameshift deletion at Gln461fs in the MLLT1 gene, that was encountered only 
in p-CSC samples with different allelic frequency.
CONCLUSIONS: We discovered a potentially harmful frameshift deletion at Gln461fs 
in the MLLT1 gene. Further investigation is required to confirm the presence of 
the identified mutations in patient tissue samples, as well as the significance 
of the frameshift mutation in the MLLT1 gene on GBM biology and response to 
therapy based on genomic functional experiments.

Therapy-related ALL (t-ALL) is a rare secondary leukemia that develops after 
chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy for primary malignancies. Chromosomal 11q23 
abnormalities are the most common karyotypic alterations in t-ALL. The 
t(11;19)(q23;p13) aberration is extremely rare and has not been confirmed at the 
molecular genetic level. Here, we report a case of t-ALL with 
t(11;19)(q23;p13.3) and MLL-MLLT1 (alias ENL) gene rearrangement confirmed by 
cytogenetic analysis, multiplex reverse transcription-PCR (multiplex RT-PCR), 
and DNA sequencing in a patient who had undergone treatment for breast cancer. A 
40-yr-old woman developed acute leukemia 15 months after undergoing 6 cycles of 
adjuvant chemotherapy (doxorubicin 60 mg/m² and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m²), 
radiation therapy (dose, 5,900 cGy), and anticancer endocrine therapy with 
tamoxifen. The complete blood cell counts and bone marrow examination showed 
increased blasts and the blasts showed B lineage immunophenotype (positive for 
CD19, CD34, and cytoplasmic CD79a). Cytogenetic analysis revealed the karyotype 
47,XX,+X,t(11;19)(q23;p13.3)[4]/46,XX[16]. FISH analyses, multiplex RT-PCR, and 
DNA sequencing confirmed the MLL-MLLT1 gene rearrangement. The patient underwent 
induction chemotherapy with fractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, 
doxorubicin, and dexamethasone (Hyper-CVAD) and achieved complete remission. 
Subsequently, she underwent consolidation chemotherapy, but died of brain 
ischemia in the pons and the region of the middle cerebral artery. To our 
knowledge, this is the first case report of t-ALL with t(11;19)(q23;p13.3) and 
the MLL-MLLT1 gene rearrangement.

Erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL), or type 2 lepra reaction, is a multi-system 
immune-mediated complication in patients with multibacillary leprosy, frequently 
associated with chronicity and recurrences. Management of ENL requires high 
doses of oral corticosteroids, which may not be universally effective and pose 
serious adverse effects. Thalidomide has proven to be a steroid-sparing agent 
and is useful in controlling the reactions. However, many centres do not employ 
it in outpatient settings due to adverse effects and teratogenicity risk. Hence, 
we studied the feasibility of treating ENLs and reported the therapeutic 
outcome.This is a five-year record-based analysis of ENL leprosy patients 
treated with thalidomide, includingdescriptive statistics of demographic 
variables. Clinical characteristics were stratified by treatment compliance 
status (yes/no). Incidence rates and rate ratios for recovery stratified by 
bacillary index, type of ENL presentation and MDT treatment status were 
calculated.Out of 102 ENL patients treated with thalidomide, 68 (66.7%) were 
compliant and improved. Among them, ENL recurrence was noted in 11(16.2%) 
patients. The commonest thalidomide side effect was pedal oedema (73.5%). 
Patients with bacillary index (BI) less than or equal to 4.0 had a 37% increase 
in the incidence of recovery. Patients with acute ENL were almost twice as 
likely to recover as those with chronic ENL. Also, the improvement was two and a 
half times greater among those who completed MDT as compared to those on MDT. 
The study showed that thalidomide treatment for patients with ENL is possible in 
outpatientclinics. We also successfully prevented pregnancies to a larger extent 
through counselling for contraception.We observed that early institution of 
thalidomide induces faster remission and prevents ENL recurrence.

Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α inhibitors increase susceptibility to 
tuberculosis, but the effect of biologics on susceptibility to leprosy has not 
been described. Moreover, biologics may play a role in treating erythema nodosum 
leprosum (ENL). The objectives of this systematic review were to determine 
whether the development of clinical leprosy is increased in patients being 
treated with biologics and to assess the use of biologics in treating leprosy 
reactions. A systematic literature review was completed of patients with leprosy 
who received treatment with biologics either before or after a diagnosis of 
leprosy was confirmed. All studies and case reports were included for 
qualitative evaluation. The search yielded 10 cases (including one duplicate 
publication) of leprosy diagnosed after initiation of TNF-α inhibitors and four 
case reports of refractory ENL successfully treated with infliximab or 
etanercept. An unpublished case of persistent ENL responsive to infliximab is 
also presented. These data demonstrate that the use of TNF-α inhibitors may be a 
risk factor for developing leprosy or reactivating subclinical infections. 
Leprosy can present with skin lesions and arthritis, so leprosy should be 
considered in patients presenting with these signs before starting treatment 
with these agents. Leprosy should be considered in patients who develop 
worsening eruptions and neurologic symptoms during treatment with TNF-α 
inhibitors. Finally, TNF-α inhibitors appear effective in some cases of 
refractory ENL.

BACKGROUND: Leprosy can cause acute reactions, which may be type 1 (reverse 
reaction) or type 2 (erythema nodosum leprosum - ENL). ENL has been classified 
as mild, moderate, or severe. In order to standardize the classification, the 
Erythema Nodosum Leprosum International Study (ENLIST) Group has developed an 
objective scale, the ENLIST ENL Severity Scale (EESS), which was the first 
validated severity scale of ENL in the world. The goal of the study was to 
describe the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of patients with ENL 
attending a tertiary hospital in Piauí, Brazil, classifying them according to 
the EESS.
METHODS: A descriptive cross-sectional observational study was conducted on 26 
patients recruited sequentially from May 2017 to February 2018. Their data were 
statistically analyzed and compared against each other through a structured 
questionnaire.
RESULTS: According to the score obtained in the scale, the patients were divided 
into two groups: mild ENL and moderate/severe ENL. The extent and number of 
nodules were related to the severity of the cases, and these data were 
statistically significant. The majority of the patients were male, between the 
ages of 31 and 49 years old, with low educational level, and residents in the 
urban area.
CONCLUSIONS: This was the first study to use EESS in Brazil. This scale is easy 
to apply and allows for the enhancement of treatment protocols. The study also 
showed a correlation between the number and extension of nodules and the 
severity of the condition.

INTRODUCTION: Erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) is an immunological complication 
of leprosy. ENL results in morbidity and disability and if it is not treated can 
lead to death. The current treatment consists of thalidomide or high doses of 
oral corticosteroids for prolonged periods. Thalidomide is not available in many 
leprosy endemic countries. The use of corticosteroids is associated with 
morbidity and mortality. Identifying treatment regimens that reduce the use of 
corticosteroids in ENL is essential. Methotrexate (MTX) is used to treat many 
inflammatory diseases and has been used successfully to treat patients with ENL 
not controlled by other drugs, including prednisolone and thalidomide. We 
present the protocol of the 'MTX and prednisolone study in ENL' (MaPs in ENL) a 
randomised controlled trial (RCT) designed to test the efficacy of MTX in the 
management of ENL.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: MaPs in ENL is an international multicentre RCT, which 
will be conducted in leprosy referral centres in Bangladesh, Brazil, Ethiopia, 
India, Indonesia and Nepal. Patients diagnosed with ENL who consent to 
participate will be randomly allocated to receive 48 weeks of weekly oral MTX 
plus 20 weeks of prednisolone or 48 weeks of placebo plus 20 weeks of 
prednisolone. Participants will be stratified by type of ENL into those with 
acute ENL and those with chronic and recurrent ENL. The primary objective is to 
determine whether MTX reduces the requirement for additional prednisolone. 
Patients' reported outcome measures will be used to assess the efficacy of MTX. 
Participants will be closely monitored for adverse events.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Results will be submitted for publication in 
peer-reviewed journals. Ethical approval was obtained from the 
Observational/Interventions Research Ethics Committee of the London School of 
Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (15762); The Leprosy Mission International

RCT of MTX for ENL and will contribute to the evidence for the management of 
ENL.Trial registration numberNCT 03775460.

Eleven-nineteen leukemia (ENL) contains an epigenetic reader domain (YEATS 
domain) that recognizes lysine acylation on histone 3 and facilitates 
transcription initiation and elongation through its interactions with the super 
elongation complex (SEC) and the histone methyl transferase DOT1L. Although it 
has been known for its role as a fusion protein in mixed lineage leukemia (MLL), 
overexpression of native ENL, and thus dysregulation of downstream genes in 
acute myeloid leukemia (AML), has recently been implicated as a driver of 
disease that is reliant on the epigenetic reader activity of the YEATS domain. 
We developed a peptide displacement assay (histone 3 tail with acylated lysine) 
and screened a small-molecule library totaling more than 24,000 compounds for 
their propensity to disrupt the YEATS domain-histone peptide binding. Among 
these, we identified a first-in-class dual inhibitor of ENL ( Kd = 745 ± 45 nM) 
and its paralog AF9 ( Kd = 523 ± 53 nM) and performed "SAR by catalog" with the 
aim of starting the development of a chemical probe for ENL.

BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common pathological process which 
occurs in hemorrhage, intoxication, etc. It has been shown that the lymphatic 
circulation plays an important regulatory role in the pathogenesis of hemorrhage 
shock, and that exogenous normal lymph (ENL) has a beneficial effect on multiple 
organ injuries. In the present study, we investigated the effect of ENL on 
lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced AKI in rats.
METHODS: The AKI was induced by the jugular vein injection of LPS (iv, 
15 mg/kg). After 15 min of LPS injection, saline or ENL without cell components 
(5 mL/kg) was iv infused at the speed of 0.5 mL per minute. Then, the renal 
function indices in plasma and renal histomorphology, and the levels of 
P-selectin, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), myeloperoxidase (MPO) 
and Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase in renal tissue were assessed at 3 or 6 h after LPS 
injection.
RESULTS: LPS induced a severe kidney injury including increased levels of urea, 
creatinine in plasma, aggrandized activities of ICAM-1 and MPO in renal tissue, 
and decreased the Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity in renal cells. These deleterious 
effects of LPS were significantly ameliorated by ENL treatment.
CONCLUSION: The present results indicate that ENL protect against LPS-induced 
AKI, suggesting an alternative therapeutic strategy for treatment of kidney 
injury accompanied with severe infection or sepsis.

Atypical Manifestations of Leprosy - A Case Series.

Vineetha M, Seena P, Sobhana KK, Celine MI, Letha V.

Atypical manifestations are not rare in leprosy and they may present diagnostic 
challenges. We report a series of five cases having atypical presentations. 
First case presented with an asymptomatic buccal lesion and later developed skin 
lesions. Second patient had secondary Anti-phosphospholipidsyndrome (APS) due to 
leprosy. We also report another interesting case of annular vesiculobullous 
lesions and erythema nodosumleprosum (ENL) following intake of antibiotics for 
pneumonia. Other two had exacerbation reactions (ER). Two of these patients were 
had irregular/incompleteanti-leprosy treatment earlier., These profiles will be 
of interest to clinicians who may encounter cases with such manifestations.

Release of paused RNA polymerase II (Pol II) requires incorporation of the 
positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) into the super elongation 
complex (SEC), thus resulting in rapid yet synchronous transcriptional 
activation. However, the mechanism underlying dynamic transition of P-TEFb from 
inactive to active state remains unclear. Here, we found that the SEC components 
are able to compartmentalize and concentrate P-TEFb via liquid-liquid phase 
separation from the soluble inactive HEXIM1 containing the P-TEFb complex. 
Specifically, ENL or its intrinsically disordered region is sufficient to 
initiate the liquid droplet formation of SEC. AFF4 functions together with ENL 
in fluidizing SEC droplets. SEC droplets are fast and dynamically formed upon 
serum exposure and required for rapid transcriptional induction. We also found 
that the fusion of ENL with MLL can boost SEC phase separation. In summary, our 
results suggest a critical role of multivalent phase separation of SEC in 
controlling transcriptional pause release.

BACKGROUND: Erythema Nodosum Leprosum (ENL) is a serious complication of 
leprosy. It is normally treated with high dose steroids, but its recurrent 
nature leads to prolonged steroid usage and associated side effects. There is 
little evidence on the efficacy of alternative treatments for ENL, especially 
for patients who have become steroid resistant or have steroid side effects. 
These two pilot studies compare the efficacy and side effect profile of 
ciclosporin plus prednisolone against prednisolone alone in the treatment of 
patients with either new ENL or chronic and recurrent ENL.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Thirteen patients with new ENL and twenty patients with 
chronic ENL were recruited into two double-blinded randomised controlled trials. 
Patients were randomised to receive ciclosporin and prednisolone or prednisolone 
treatment only. Patients with acute ENL had a delay of 16 weeks in the 
occurrence of ENL flare-up episode, with less severe flare-ups and decreased 
requirements for additional prednisolone. Patients with chronic ENL on 
ciclosporin had the first episode of ENL flare-up 4 weeks earlier than those on 
prednisolone, as well as more severe ENL flare-ups requiring 2.5 times more 
additional prednisolone. Adverse events attributable to prednisolone were more 
common that those attributable to ciclosporin.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first clinical trial on ENL management set in the 
African context, and also the first trial in leprosy to use patients' assessment 
of outcomes. Patients on ciclosporin showed promising results in the management 
of acute ENL in this small pilot study. But ciclosporin, did not appear to have 
a significant steroid-sparing effects in patients with chronic ENL, which may 
have been due to the prolonged use of steroids in these patients in combination 
with a too rapid decrease of steroids in patients given ciclosporin. Further 
research is needed to determine whether the promising results of ciclosporin in 
acute ENL can be reproduced on a larger scale.

Management of chronic/recurrent erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) is challenging. 
The majority of these patients become steroid-dependent and suffer from the 
adverse effects of long-term corticosteroid use. Minocycline has shown promising 
results in a small series of chronic/recurrent ENL patients. The aim of this 
study was to compare the efficacy and safety of minocycline and clofazimine in 
patients with chronic/recurrent ENL. In this prospective randomized clinical 
trial, 60 participants with chronic/recurrent ENL were randomized (1:1) to 
receive either minocycline 100 mg once daily or clofazimine 100 mg thrice daily 
for 12 weeks along with prednisolone according to WHO protocol and followed up 
for 6 months. The outcome measures were mean time for initial control of ENL, 
proportion of patients having a recurrence of ENL, mean time for recurrence 
after initial control, additional prednisolone requirement, and frequency of 
adverse events. Initial control of ENL was achieved earlier in the minocycline 
group as compared to the clofazimine group (2.97 ± 1.9 weeks vs. 4 ± 1.96 weeks, 
respectively; p-0.048). The number of participants having ENL flares/recurrences 
during the study period was comparable in both groups (71.4% in clofazimine vs. 
55.2% in minocycline group; p-0.2). The participants in the minocycline group 
remained in remission for a longer duration after initial control of ENL as 
compared to the clofazimine group (p-0.001). Mean additional prednisolone dose 
required for control of ENL flares/recurrences was also comparable in both 
groups (p-0.09). The minocycline group had fewer side effects than the 
clofazimine group (p-0.047). Minocycline led to a rapid and sustained 
improvement of ENL episodes with fewer adverse events showing a superior 
efficacy to clofazimine.

BACKGROUND: Leprosy reactions are a significant cause of morbidity in leprosy 
population. Erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) is an immunological complication 
affecting approximately 50% of patients with lepromatous leprosy (LL) and 10% of 
borderline lepromatous (BL) leprosy. ENL is associated with clinical features 
such as skin lesions, neuritis, arthritis, dactylitis, eye inflammation, 
osteitis, orchitis, lymphadenitis and nephritis. ENL is treated mainly with 
corticosteroids and corticosteroids are often required for extended periods of 
time which may lead to serious adverse effects. High mortality rate and 
increased morbidity associated with corticosteroid treatment of ENL has been 
reported. For improved and evidence-based treatment of ENL, documenting the 
systems affected by ENL is important. We report here the clinical features of 
ENL in a cohort of patients with acute ENL who were recruited for a 
clinico-pathological study before and after prednisolone treatment.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A case-control study was performed at ALERT hospital, 
Ethiopia. Forty-six LL patients with ENL and 31 non-reactional LL matched 
controls were enrolled to the study and followed for 28 weeks. Clinical features 
were systematically documented at three visits (before, during and after 
predinsolone treatment of ENL cases) using a specifically designed form. Skin 
biopsy samples were obtained from each patient before and after treatment and 
used for histopathological investigations to supplement the clinical data.
RESULTS: Pain was the most common symptom reported (98%) by patients with ENL. 
Eighty percent of them had reported skin pain and more than 70% had nerve and 
joint pain at enrolment. About 40% of the patients developed chronic ENL. Most 
individuals 95.7% had nodular skin lesions. Over half of patients with ENL had 
old nerve function impairment (NFI) while 13% had new NFI at enrolment. Facial 
and limb oedema were present in 60% patients. Regarding pathological findings 
before treatment, dermal neutrophilic infiltration was noted in 58.8% of 
patients with ENL compared to 14.3% in LL controls. Only 14.7% patients with ENL 
had evidence of vasculitis at enrolment.
CONCLUSION: In our study, painful nodular skin lesions were present in all ENL 
patients. Only 58% patients had dermal polymorphonuclear cell infiltration 
showing that not all clinically confirmed ENL cases have neutrophilic 
infiltration in lesions. Very few patients had histological evidence of 
vasculitis. Many patients developed chronic ENL and these patients require 
inpatient corticosteroid treatment for extended periods which challenges the 
health service facility in resource poor settings, as well as the patient's 
quality of life.

The liver is one of the target organs damaged by septic shock, wherein the 
spread of endotoxins begins. This study aimed to investigate the effects of 
exogenous normal lymph (ENL) on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced liver injury in 
rats. Male Wistar rats were randomly divided into sham, LPS, and LPS+ENL groups. 
LPS (15 mg/kg) was administered intravenously via the left jugular vein to the 
LPS and LPS+ENL groups. At 15 min after the LPS injection, saline or ENL without 
cell components (5 mL/kg) was administered to the LPS and LPS+ENL groups, 
respectively, at a rate of 0.5 mL/min. Hepatocellular injury indices and hepatic 
histomorphology, as well as levels of P-selectin, intercellular adhesion 
molecule 1 (ICAM-1), myeloperoxidase (MPO), and Na+-K+-ATPase, were assessed in 
hepatic tissues. Liver tissue damage occurred after LPS injection. All levels of 
alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) in plasma as 
well as the wet/dry weight ratio of hepatic tissue in plasma increased. 
Similarly, P-selectin, ICAM-1, and MPO levels in hepatic tissues were elevated, 
whereas Na+-K+-ATPase activity in hepatocytes decreased. ENL treatment lessened 
hepatic tissue damage and decreased levels of AST, ALT, ICAM-1, and MPO. 
Meanwhile, the treatment increased the activity of Na+-K+-ATPase. These results 
indicated that ENL could alleviate LPS-induced liver injury, thereby suggesting 
an alternative therapeutic strategy for the treatment of liver injury 
accompanied by severe infection or sepsis.

Erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) or type 2 lepra reactions complicate lepromatous 
leprosy and borderline lepromatous leprosy. We report an 11-year retrospective 
case record analysis of 481 outpatients with borderline lepromatous and 
lepromatous leprosy at the Dhoolpet Leprosy Research Center in Hyderabad, 
India.. The overall prevalence of ENL was 24%, 49.4% among cases of lepromatous 
leprosy (LL) and 9% among cases of borderline lepromatous (BL) leprosy. Logistic 
regression analysis identified LL (odds ratio [OR] = 8.4, 95% confidence 
interval [CI] = 4.6-15.4, P < 0.001) and BL with a bacterial index > or = 4+ (OR 
= 5.2, 95% CI = 2.1-12.9, P = 0.001) as major risk factors. The average patient 
with ENL was male, 34.7 years of age, and had multiple episodes of ENL (mean = 
3.1) over an 18.5-month period. Three types of ENL were identified: single acute 
ENL, multiple acute ENL (repeated discrete episodes), and chronic ENL 
(continuous episodes). Acute single ENL is rare, accounting for only 8% of 
cases. Chronic ENL accounted for 62.5% of the cohort. Chronic ENL was of longer 
duration and more severe. An age > or = 35 years was a risk factor for 
developing chronic ENL. Patients with chronic ENL were more compliant with 
multi-drug therapy, especially during the first six doses of multi-drug therapy. 
Distinguishing these different types of ENL would be useful for patient 
management and developing improved treatment of these debilitating reactions. 
Improved strategies for treatment and management of these reactions need to be 
developed.

Erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) is an inflammatory complication in leprosy. Yet, 
the involvement of ENL neutrophils in the inflammatory response against 
Mycobacterium leprae remains poorly explored. Our primary aim was to investigate 
the utility of the surface expression of neutrophil IL-10R1 as an ENL biomarker 
and, secondarily, to evaluate whether leprosy or healthy M. leprae-stimulated 
neutrophils produce cytokines and are able to respond to IL-10. We, in this 
study, describe a subpopulation of circulating neutrophils of ENL patients that 
exclusively expressed IL-10R1, providing evidence that IL-10R1+ neutrophils are 
present in ENL lesions. It was also found that ENL neutrophils, but not those of 
nonreactional leprosy controls, were able to secret detectable levels of TNF ex 
vivo and the addition of IL-10 blocked TNF release. It was likewise observed 
that M. leprae-stimulated, healthy neutrophils expressed IL-10R1 in vitro, and 
ENL-linked cytokines were released by M. leprae-cultured neutrophils in vitro. 
Moreover, consistent with the presence of a fully functional IL-10R, the 
addition of IL-10 prevented the release of M. leprae-induced cytokines. Most 
importantly, dead M. leprae revealed its superior capacity to induce CCL4 and 
IL-8 in primary neutrophils over live Mycobacterium, suggesting that M. leprae 
may hamper the inflammatory machinery as an immune escape mechanism.

Erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) occurs as an immunological complication of 
multibacillary leprosy (MBL). The pathogenesis of ENL is long considered to be a 
T-cell-mediated process. The role of B cells and plasma cells in ENL is not well 
described in the literature. Therefore, we investigated the B-cell and plasma 
cell infiltrates in the skin biopsies of biopsy-proven cases of ENL by 
immunohistochemistry and image morphometry and compared the result with 
paucibacillary leprosy and MBL. Moreover, we sought a correlation of the B-cell 
and plasma cell infiltrates with different clinical, hematological, 
histopathological, and bacteriological parameters as well as the T-cell subsets 
in the skin biopsies. Our study highlighted a significant reduction in the 
number of B cells from paucibacillary leprosy to MBL to ENL, although there was 
no significant variation in the plasma cell infiltrate. The plasma cell 
infiltrate correlated with absolute neutrophilia in the blood and the presence 
of eosinophils in the ENL lesions. Both B cells and plasma cells positively 
correlated with CD4-positive T-helper cells and the CD8-positive cytotoxic T 
cells. Besides, the B cells also correlated positively with the CD3-positive pan 
T cells in the biopsy and negatively correlated with the T-regulatory:T-cell 
ratio. Our results suggested the role of B cells and plasma cells even at the 
tissue level in the pathobiogenesis of ENL.

BACKGROUND: NAFLD as a result of inappropriate diet and obesity, may progress to 
sever conditions such as: type 2 diabetes mellitus or steatohepatitis, and has 
recently become a prevalent topic of numerous investigations. Due to its 
dangerous aftermaths, finding new substances, such as polyphenols and their 
derivatives, which might reduce liver steatosis is the main target of research 
into NAFLD treatment. Hence, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the 
effect(s) of enterolactone (ENL), a metabolite of secoisolariciresinol (SECO), 
on lipid metabolism together with changes in the expression of fatty acid 
transporters in fatty liver.
METHODS: The experiments were conducted on HepG2 cells incubated with either ENL 
and/or palmitic acid during 16 h exposure. The expression of selected fatty acid 
transport proteins: FATP2, FATP5, CD36, FABPpm, ABCA1, MTP, ACBP and L-FABP, as 
well as the proteins directly involved in lipogenesis (FAS), oxidation pathway 
(CPT 1), and lipid metabolism (PPARα, LXR, SREBP1c, pAMPK) was estimated by 
Western Blot. Intra and extracellular lipid contents were assessed by Gas-Liquid 
Chromatography. The data was analyzed with two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), 
and results were considered to be statistically significant at p ≤ 0.05.
RESULTS: ENL stimulated extracellular efflux of free fatty acids (FFA) and 
triacylglicerols (TAG) to the medium, while, it had no influence on FATP-family 
mediated intracellular fatty acid uptake. Moreover, ENL decreased the expression 
of CPT 1, pAMPK, PPARα, increased SREBP1c and had no effect on LXR, and FAS 
content.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings of our study demonstrate that ENL had opposite effect 
on liver steatosis in comparison with other polyphenols what suggests that it 
may be an inactive metabolite. ENL did not affect significantly the 
intracellular accumulation of FFA, DAG and TAG, yet it promoted their 
extracellular efflux. Furthermore, it inhibited ß-oxydation and intracellular 
lipid metabolism what may contribute to the progression of NAFLD.

The HRX gene (also called MLL, ALL-1, and Htrx) at chromosome band 11q23 is 
associated with specific subsets of acute leukemias through translocations that 
result in its fusion with a variety of heterologous partners. Two of these 
partners, ENL and AF9, code for proteins that are highly similar to each other 
and as fusions with HRX induce myeloid leukemias in mice as demonstrated by 
retroviral gene transfer and knock-in experiments, respectively. In the present 
study, a structure-function analysis was performed to determine the molecular 
requirements for in vitro immortalization of murine myeloid cells by HRX-ENL. 
Deletions of either the AT hook motifs or the methyltransferase homology domain 
of HRX substantially impaired the transforming effects of HRX-ENL. The 
methyltransferase homology domain was shown to bind non-sequence specifically to 
DNA in vitro, providing evidence that the full transforming activity of HRX-ENL 
requires multiple DNA binding structures in HRX. The carboxy-terminal 84 amino 
acids of ENL, which encode two predicted helical structures highly conserved in 
AF9, were necessary and sufficient for transformation when they were fused to 
HRX. Similarly, mutations that deleted one or both of these conserved helices 
completely abrogated the transcriptional activation properties of ENL. This 
finding correlates, for the first time, a biological function of an HRX fusion 
partner with the transforming activity of the chimeric proteins. Our studies 
support a model in which HRX-ENL induces myeloid transformation by deregulating 
subordinate genes through a gain of function contributed by the transcriptional 
effector properties of ENL.

Cooperative gene activation by AF4 and DOT1L drives MLL-rearranged leukemia.

Okuda H, Stanojevic B, Kanai A, Kawamura T, Takahashi S, Matsui H, Takaori-Kondo 
A, Yokoyama A.

The eleven-nineteen leukemia (ENL) protein family, composed of ENL and AF9, is a 
common component of 3 transcriptional modulators: AF4-ENL-P-TEFb complex (AEP), 
DOT1L-AF10-ENL complex (referred to as the DOT1L complex) and 
polycomb-repressive complex 1 (PRC1). Each complex associates with chromatin via 
distinct mechanisms, conferring different transcriptional properties including 
activation, maintenance, and repression. The mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) gene 
often fuses with ENL and AF10 family genes in leukemia. However, the functional 
interrelationship among those 3 complexes in leukemic transformation remains 
largely elusive. Here, we have shown that MLL-ENL and MLL-AF10 constitutively 
activate transcription by aberrantly inducing both AEP-dependent transcriptional 
activation and DOT1L-dependent transcriptional maintenance, mostly in the 
absence of PRC1, to fully transform hematopoietic progenitors. These results 
reveal a cooperative transcriptional activation mechanism of AEP and DOT1L and 
suggest a molecular rationale for the simultaneous inhibition of the MLL 
fusion-AF4 complex and DOT1L for more effective treatment of MLL-rearranged 
leukemia.

retrovirally transduced HRX-ENL.

A subset of chromosomal translocations in acute leukemias results in the fusion 
of the trithorax-related protein HRX with a variety of heterologous proteins. In 
particular, leukemias with the t(11;19)(q23;p13.3) translocation express HRX-ENL 
fusion proteins and display features which suggest the malignant transformation 
of myeloid and/or lymphoid progenitor(s). To characterize directly the potential 
transforming effects of HRX-ENL on primitive hematopoietic precursors, the 
fusion cDNA was transduced by retroviral gene transfer into cell populations 
enriched in hematopoietic stem cells. The infected cells had a dramatically 
enhanced potential to generate myeloid colonies with primitive morphology in 
vitro. Primary colonies could be replated for at least three generations in 
vitro and established primitive myelomonocytic cell lines upon transfer into 
suspension cultures supplemented with interleukin-3 and stem cell factor. 
Immortalized cells contained structurally intact HRX-ENL proviral DNA and 
expressed a low-level of HRX-ENL mRNA. In contrast, wild-type ENL or a deletion 
mutant of HRX-ENL lacking the ENL component did not demonstrate in vitro 
transforming capabilities. Immortalized cells or enriched primary hematopoietic 
stem cells transduced with HRX-ENL induced myeloid leukemias in syngeneic and 
SCID recipients. These studies demonstrate a direct role for HRX-ENL in the 
immortalization and leukemic transformation of a myeloid progenitor and support 
a gain-of-function mechanism for HRX-ENL-mediated leukemogenesis.

Erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) is a systemic inflammatory complication 
occurring mainly in patients with lepromatous leprosy (LL) and borderline 
lepromatous leprosy. Prednisolone is widely used for treatment of ENL reactions 
but clinical improvement varies. However, there is little good in vivo data as 
to the effect of prednisolone treatment on the pro-inflammatory cytokines in 
patients with ENL reactions. As a result, treatment and management of reactional 
and post-reactional episodes of ENL often pose a therapeutic challenge. We 
investigated the effect of prednisolone treatment on the inflammatory cytokines 
TNF, IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-17 and the regulatory cytokines IL-10 and TGF-β 
in the skin lesion and blood of patients with ENL and compared with 
non-reactional LL patient controls. A case-control study was employed to recruit 
30 patients with ENL and 30 non-reactional LL patient controls at ALERT 
Hospital, Ethiopia. Blood and skin biopsy samples were obtained from each 
patient before and after prednisolone treatment. Peripheral blood mononuclear 
cells from patients with ENL cases and LL controls were cultured with M. leprae 
whole-cell sonicates (MLWCS), phytohemagglutinin or no stimulation for 6 days. 
The supernatants were assessed with the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for 
inflammatory and regulatory cytokines. For cytokine gene expression, mRNA was 
isolated from whole blood and skin lesions and then reverse transcribed into 
cDNA. The mRNA gene expression was quantified on a Light Cycler using real-time 
PCR assays specific to TNF, IFN-γ, IL-β, TGF-β, IL-17A, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10. 
The ex vivo production of the cytokines: TNF, IFN-γ, IL-1β, and IL-17A was 
significantly increased in untreated patients with ENL. However, IL-10 
production was significantly lower in untreated patients with ENL and 
significantly increased after treatment. The ex vivo production of IL-6 and IL-8 
in patients with ENL did not show statistically significant differences before 
and after prednisolone treatment. The mRNA expression in blood and skin lesion 
for TNF, IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-17A significantly reduced in patients with 
ENL after treatment, while mRNA expression for IL-10 and TGF-β was significantly 
increased both in blood and skin lesion after treatment. This is the first study 
examining the effect of prednisolone on the kinetics of inflammatory and 
regulatory cytokines in patients with ENL reactions before and after 
prednisolone treatment. Our findings suggest that prednisolone modulates the 
pro-inflammatory cytokines studied here either directly or through suppression 
of the immune cells producing these inflammatory cytokines.

Eleven-nineteen leukemia (ENL) is a chromatin reader present in complexes 
stimulating transcriptional elongation. It is fused to mixed-lineage leukemia 
(MLL) in leukemia, and missense mutations have been identified in Wilms tumor 
and acute myeloid leukemia. Here we demonstrate that ENL overcomes polycomb 
silencing through recruitment of PAF1 via the conserved YEATS domain, which 
recognizes acetylated histone H3. PAF1 was responsible for antirepressive 
activities of ENL in vitro, and it determined the transforming potential of 
MLL-ENL. MLL-ENL target loci showed supraphysiological PAF1 binding, 
hyperubiquitination of histone H2B and hypomodification with H2AUb, resulting in 
accelerated transcription rates. YEATS mutations induced a gain of function, 
transforming primary hematopoietic cells in vitro and in transplantation assays 
through aberrant transcription and H2B ubiquitination of Hoxa9 and Meis1 
Mechanistically, H3 and PAF1 competed for ENL interaction, with activating 
mutations favoring PAF1 binding, whereas the MLL moiety provided a constitutive 
PAF1 tether allowing MLL fusions to circumvent H3 competition.

in a patient with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and t(2;19;11) (p12;p13.3;q23).

Translocations involving mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene at 11q23 are 
associated with de novo acute leukemia as well as therapy-related acute 
leukemia. More than 100 different translocations involving MLL have been 
described in acute leukemia, with more than 60 translocation partner genes 
characterized on the molecular level. In addition to various simple 
translocations affecting MLL, there are also complex forms involving three or 
more chromosomes. Here, we describe a novel three-way translocation of 
t(2;19;11)(p12;p13.3;q23) in a patient with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). 
In this translocation, the distal 19p13.3 joins the proximal 11q23 on der(11), 
whereas the distal 11q23 is translocated to 2p12. Three-way translocations 
involving 11q23 are often difficult to detect with cytogenetic means alone. In 
the present case, however, the chromosomes involved in the three-way 
translocation were readily identifiable by GTG banding. The MLL-MLLT1 fusion 
products from the derivative chromosome 11 were detected by reverse 
transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and two splicing variant forms 
were confirmed by cloning and sequencing. Furthermore, the novel third partner 
gene, NRXN1, was detected by systematic breakpoint analysis using long-distance 
inverse-PCR methods (LDI-PCR). The apparent three-way translocation thus 
identified is noteworthy because few studies have reported complex 
rearrangements involving 11q23 and 19p13.3 in acute leukemias.

PURPOSE: Enterolactone (ENL) is formed in the human gut after consumption of 
lignans, has estrogenic properties, and has been associated with risk of 
prostate cancer. We examined the association between plasma ENL levels and 
prostate cancer in a nested case-control study within the population-based Malmö 
Diet and Cancer cohort. We also examined the association between plasma ENL and 
dietary and lifestyle factors.
METHODS: The study population consisted of 1010 cases occurring during a mean 
follow-up of 14.6 years, and 1817 controls matched on age and study entry date. 
We used national registers (95%) and hospital records (5%) to ascertain cases. 
Diet was estimated by a modified diet history method. Plasma ENL concentrations 
were determined by a time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay. Odds ratios were 
calculated by unconditional logistic regression.
RESULTS: There were no significant associations between plasma ENL and incidence 
of all prostate cancer (odds ratio 0.99 [95% confidence interval 0.77-1.280] for 
the highest ENL quintile versus lowest, p for trend 0.66). However, in certain 
subgroups of men, including men with abdominal obesity (p for 
interaction = 0.012), we observed associations between high ENL levels and lower 
odds of high-risk prostate cancer. Plasma ENL was positively associated with 
consumption of high-fibre bread, fruit, tea, and coffee; with age, and with 
height, while it was negatively associated with smoking and waist circumference; 
however, although significant, all associations were rather weak (r ≤ |0.14|).
CONCLUSION: ENL concentration was not consistently associated with lower 
prostate cancer risk, although it was weakly associated with a healthy 
lifestyle.

BACKGROUND: Leprosy morbidity is increased by 2 pathologic immune reactions, 
reversal reaction (RR) and erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL).
METHODS: To discover host factors related to immune reactions, global 
transcriptional profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells were compared 
between 11 RR, 11 ENL, and 19 matched control patients, with confirmation by 
quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Encoded proteins were investigated in 
skin biopsy specimens by means of immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: There were 275 genes differentially expressed in RR and 517 
differentially expressed in ENL on the microarray. Pathway analysis showed 
immunity-related pathways represented in RR and ENL transcriptional profiles, 
with the "complement and coagulation" pathway common to both. Interferon γ was 
identified as a significant upstream regulator of the expression changes for RR 
and ENL. Immunohistochemical staining of skin lesions showed increased C1q in 
both RR and ENL.
CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest a previously underrecognized role for complement 
in the pathogenesis of both RR and ENL, and we propose new hypotheses for 
reaction pathogenesis.

AIMS: Obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus, correlate with increased tissue 
concentration of sphingolipids, which directly interfere with insulin signaling 
pathway. Phytoestrogens are a group of plant-derived compounds that have been 
studied in the case of metabolic disorders treatment. Therefore, the aim of this 
study was to ascertain whether enterolactone (ENL), a commonly known 
phytoestrogen, may affect sphingolipid metabolism and decrease hepatic insulin 
resistance development in a lipid overload state.
MAIN METHODS: The study was conducted on HepG2 cells incubated with ENL and/or 
palmitic acid (PA) for 16 h. Intra- and extracellular sphingolipid 
concentrations were assessed by high performance liquid chromatography. The 
expression of sphingolipid pathway enzymes, apoptosis and insulin signaling 
pathway proteins and glucose metabolism regulators were evaluated by Western 
Blot.
KEY FINDINGS: In HepG2 cells, a considerable augmentation of intracellular 
ceramide and sphingosine concentration in ENL with PA group were indicated with 
simultaneous increase in extracellular ceramide concentration. The ENL treatment 
increased expression of selected enzymes from de novo ceramide synthesis pathway 
with lower expression of ceramide transfer protein. We also observed a decreased 
expression of insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of AKT and AMPK after exposure 
to ENL with PA. Our research demonstrated that ENL with PA resulted in an 
increased expression of caspase-3.
SIGNIFICANCE: Enterolactone, in a higher fatty acids availability, led to the 
development of hepatic IR in HepG2 cells. This phenomenon may be the result of 
elevated intracellular ceramide accumulation caused by increased de novo 
synthesis pathway what led to enhanced apoptosis of HepG2 cells.

Can the combination of flaxseed and its lignans with soy and its isoflavones 
reduce the growth stimulatory effect of soy and its isoflavones on established 
breast cancer?

Canada.

Consumption of phytoestrogen (PE)-rich foods (i. e., soy and flaxseed (FS)) is 
increasing because of their suggested health benefits. However, recent studies 
raise concern over the safety of soy and its isoflavones, particularly genistein 
(GEN), for postmenopausal breast cancer (BC), due to their potential stimulatory 
effects on human breast tissue and on the growth of existing tumors in rodents. 
FS, rich in PE lignans, which is metabolized to the mammalian lignans 
enterolactone (ENL) and enterodiol (END), has consistently been shown to have 
tumor inhibitory effects in a human clinical trial as well as rodent BC models. 
Using the preclinical athymic mouse postmenopausal BC model, combining FS with 
soy protein or GEN with END and ENL, was found to negate the tumor stimulatory 
effects of soy protein or GEN alone. The mechanism may be related to the 
modulation of estrogen receptor and MAPK signaling pathways. If these studies 
can be confirmed in clinical trials, then consumption of combined soy and FS, or 
their PEs, may reduce the tumor growth stimulatory effect of soy or GEN. This 
may indicate that if soy is consumed with lignan-rich foods, it may continue to 
induce its other beneficial health effects, without inducing adverse effect on 
postmenopausal BC.

Translocations involving the mixed lineage leukemia-1 are recurrent events in 
acute leukemia and associate with lymphoid (ALL), myeloid (AML) or mixed lineage 
(MLL) subtypes. Despite an association with ALL in humans, murine MLL fusion 
models are persistently restricted to AML. We here explored this issue using an 
inducible mixed lineage leukemia-eleven nineteen leukemia (MLL-ENL) mouse model. 
Although multiple progenitor cell types with myeloid potential are potent AML 
leukemia-initiating cells, also the earliest lymphoid progenitors were capable 
of initiating AML. This ability to evoke a latent myeloid potential in the 
earliest lymphoid progenitors was lost upon further lymphoid commitment. At the 
same time, more downstream/committed lymphoid precursors also failed to initiate 
lymphoid leukemia. Co-expression of MLL-ENL with a constitutively active RAS 
allele, the most common co-mutation in MLL fusion leukemias, could influence on 
both disease latency and lineage assignment of developing leukemia in what 
appears to be a mutation-order-dependent manner. Finally, CEBPB-mediated 
transdifferentation of committed and otherwise leukemia-incompetent B-cell 
progenitors imbued these cells with leukemic competence for AML. Therefore, 
apart from providing detailed insight into the differential responsiveness of 
candidate target cells to a first-hit MLL fusion event, our data warrants 
caution to therapeutic approaches based on the concept of transdifferentiation.

Cell-mediated immunity in amyloidosis secondary to lepromatous leprosy.

Anders EM, McAdam KP, Anders RF.

Cell-mediated immunity in lepromatous leprosy patients with and without 
amyloidosis has been studied. Amyloidosis occurred mostly in patients with a 
history of recurrent erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) reactions. For this reason, 
two control groups of leprosy patients were included, one having a history of 
recurrent ENL and the other little or no ENL. The lack of responsiveness to 
lepromin in vivo and in vitro, characteristic of lepromatous leprosy, was not 
altered by the presence of amyloidosis or a history of ENL. No significant 
difference between the patient groups was observed in the response to PPD in 
vitro, but skin reactivity to PPD was significantly lower in the patients with 
amyloidosis than in those without amyloidosis. In contrast, the PHA responses of 
patients with amyloidosis were significantly higher than those of control 
patients without a history of ENL, but not significantly different from those of 
control patients with a history of recurrent ENL. Lepromatous leprosy patients 
who develop amyloidosis thus appear to belong to a group, susceptible to 
repeated attacks of ENL, whose PHA responses are higher than those of other 
lepromatous leprosy patients. The lower skin reactivity to PPD observed in the 
amyloid group may reflect a general impairment in delayed cutaneous 
hypersensitivity.

Stimulation of transcriptional elongation is a key activity of leukemogenic MLL 
fusion proteins. Here, we provide evidence that MLL-ENL also inhibits 
Polycomb-mediated silencing as a prerequisite for efficient transformation. 
Biochemical studies identified ENL as a scaffold that contacted the elongation 
machinery as well as the Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) component CBX8. 
These interactions were mutually exclusive in vitro, corresponding to an 
antagonistic behavior of MLL-ENL and CBX8 in vivo. CBX8 inhibited elongation in 
a specific reporter assay, and this effect was neutralized by direct association 
with ENL. Correspondingly, CBX8-binding-defective MLL-ENL could not fully 
activate gene loci necessary for transformation. Finally, we demonstrate 
dimerization of MLL-ENL as a neomorphic activity that may augment Polycomb 
inhibition and transformation.

Leukaemia lineage specification caused by cell-specific Mll-Enl translocations.

Chromosomal translocations involving the Mixed-Lineage Leukaemia (MLL) gene 
underlie many human leukaemias and MLL rearrangements are found in both acute 
myelogenous and acute lymphoblastic leukaemias. To assess the functionally 
relevant haematopoietic cell contexts for MLL fusions to be tumorigenic, we have 
generated different lines of mice in which de novo Mll-associated translocations 
occur. In these models, reciprocal chromosomal translocations occur by means of 
Cre-loxP-mediated recombination (translocator mice) in different cells of the 
haematopoietic system (namely haematopoietic stem cells, semi-committed 
progenitors or committed T or B cells). Translocations between Mll and Enl cause 
myeloid neoplasias, initiating in stem cells or progenitors while no tumours 
arose when the translocation was restricted to the B-cell compartment. Despite 
the absence of tumorigenesis, Mll-Enl translocations did occur and Mll-Enl 
fusion mRNA was expressed in B-cell-restricted translocators. A permissive 
cellular environment is therefore required for oncogenicity of Mll-associated 
translocations since the occurrence of Mll-Enl does not promote unrestricted 
proliferation in all haematopoietic cellular contexts, consistent with a 
specific instructive role of the MLL-fusion proteins in leukaemogenesis.

The revival of thalidomide began shortly after the drug was withdrawn from the 
market because of its teratogenic properties. Therapeutic effects of thalidomide 
were found accidentally in leprosy patients with erythema nodosum leprosum 
(ENL). Subsequent research widened the understanding of the activity of 
thalidomide, and with improved methodology and the augmented background 
knowledge of immunology it was possible to interpret the properties of 
thalidomide more coherently. Effects on tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) 
release play an important role in the ability of thalidomide to affect the 
immune system. Alteration of synthesis and release of cytokines such as 
interleukin (IL)-1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12 and interferon-gamma is 
involved in the complex mechanisms of thalidomide. Thalidomide targets 
leucocytes, endothelial cells and keratinocytes, affecting them in a different 
manner and at different cellular levels. Changes in the density of adhesion 
molecules alter leucocyte extravasation and the inflammatory response in the 
tissue involved. Several mechanisms for the teratogenic action of thalidomide 
are currently under review, but this mode of action of the drug still remains 
unclear and we review evidence-based hypotheses for the teratogenicity of 
thalidomide. Thalidomide shows significant clinical impact in several diseases 
such as ENL in lepromatous leprosy, chronic graft-versus-host disease, systemic 
lupus erythematosus, sarcoidosis, aphthous lesions in HIV infection, wasting 
syndrome in chronic illness, inflammatory bowel disease, multiple myeloma and 
some solid tumours. In 1998 the US Food and Drug Administration approved 
thalidomide exclusively for the treatment of ENL, and strict conditions were 
stipulated for its use in order to prevent teratogenic adverse effects. However, 
despite the promising findings of thalidomide at the molecular level, namely its 
anti-TNFalpha properties and its intercalation with DNA, and activity in 
clinical trials, there is still a great need for more intensive research.

The inverse association between a high enterolactone (ENL) concentration in both 
urine and serum, and the risk of breast cancer found in epidemiological studies 
suggests a chemopreventive action for ENL. However, no causal relationship has 
been established in clinical studies or in experimental models for breast 
cancer. In the present study, the potential chemopreventive action of p.o. 
administered ENL (1 or 10 mg/kg of body weight) was tested in 
7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene-induced mammary cancers of the rat. Rats were 
maintained on a standard open-formula chow diet. Daily p.o. administration of 
ENL at a dose of 10 mg/kg of body weight for 7 weeks significantly inhibited 
tumor growth. The growth-inhibitory effect of ENL was more pronounced on the new 
tumors, which developed during the treatment period, but ENL also inhibited the 
growth of those tumors established before the start of the lignan 
administration. The rat serum concentration of ENL, which illustrated a 
permanent positive effect on breast cancer growth, was 0.4 microM, which is 
>10-fold as compared with the serum concentrations found in the general human 
population. The effect of ENL was not restricted to any specific histological 
tumor type. ENL was demonstrated to act as a weak aromatase inhibitor in vitro 
and to reduce the relative uterine weight of the 
7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene-treated nonovariectomized rats. However, in a 
short-term assay ENL had no effect on the uterine growth of the intact or 
androstenedione-treated immature rats. Thus, the mechanism of the ENL action and 
its minimum or optimal daily dose remains to be clarified.

Nagar, New Delhi 110029, India.

Thalidomide was synthesized in 1954 in erstwhile West Germany and marketed as a 
sedative in over 46 countries until the early 1960s. Owing to serious 
teratogenic effects, the drug was withdrawn from the market in 1961. A chance 
observation suggested the utility of thalidomide in erythema nodosum leprosum 
(ENL). After many controlled and uncontrolled trials were published, the World 
Health Organization recommended its use in ENL. The Food and Drug 
Administration, USA approved it for use in ENL in July 1998. Only established 
and well-defined studies conducted to substantiate the efficacy of thalidomide 
have been included in this review. Thalidomide is considered the drug of choice 
for the treatment of ENL, but for other conditions, it is recommended only when 
resistance to the currently available form of therapy is encountered. Once the 
anti-inflammatory, immuno-modulatory, anti-TNF-alpha and anti-angiogenic 
properties of thalidomide were discovered, it was also tried in AIDS and related 
wasting, apthous ulcers, microsporidiosis and Kaposi's sarcoma. Thalidomide has 
no clinical place as an immunosuppressant in solid organ transplantation. 
However, it has a therapeutic role in graft-verus-host-disease. Among the 
dermatological conditions, thalidomide has been found to be effective in 
systemic lupus erythematosus, discoid lupus erythematosus, actinic prurigo and 
prurigo nodularis. Used correctly, it is a safe and effective medicine (except 
for its teratogenic potential and delayed neuropathy) in a variety of disease 
conditions.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the utility of detecting endocervical cervical 
intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2+ with endocervical curettage (ECC) and 
treating with loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) plus top hat (+TH) 
among women with HIV.
METHODS: Cytology was followed by coloscopy-directed biopsy if participants had 
HSIL or ASC-H and biopsy plus ECC if there were glandular cells present. CIN2/3 
on ECC and/or inadequate colposcopy (ENL) was treated with LEEP+TH, while CIN2/3 
on ectocervix (ECL) received LEEP alone. Recurrent CIN2+ were compared over a 
2-year follow-up.
RESULTS: Of 5330 participants, 160 underwent ECC, 98 were CIN2/3 on ECC, and 77 
received LEEP+TH. ECC detected 15 (9%) more women with CIN2/3 than biopsy alone. 
Women were more likely to have ENL if they were older (≥45 vs <35 years) 
(adjusted relative risk [aRR] 2.14; P = 0.009) and on antiretroviral treatment 
longer (≥2 vs <2 years) (aRR 3.97; P < 0.001). Over the 2-year follow-up, 35 
(29%) ENL had recurrent CIN2+ after TH compared to 19 (24%) ECL after LEEP 
(hazard ratio 1.32; 95% confidence interval 0.75-2.31; P = 0.338).
CONCLUSION: Among HIV-infected women, adding ECC did not increase detection of 
pre-cancerous disease significantly and treatment with LEEP+TH for ENL was 
comparable to treatment with LEEP for ECL.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the occurrence, duration and severity of ENL in leprosy 
patients treated with either 12 or 24 months of standard multi-drug therapy 
(MDT).
STUDY POPULATION: 296 patients treated with MDT for 2 years, between 1985 and 
1992 and followed up as part of a relapse study; and 293 patients, treated 
between 1998 and 2004, with MDT for 1 year and also followed up as part of a 
relapse study. The Chi squared test and multiple logistic regression analysis 
were used to test for statistical significance.
RESULTS: ENL was not significantly more common, but it was longer-lasting and 
more severe in patients receiving only 12 months of MDT, as compared with those 
receiving 24 months treatment. A high BI at the start of treatment significantly 
increased the risk of severe ENL by a factor of between 6 and 12, while 
treatment with 12 instead of 24 months of MDT significantly increased the risk 
by a factor of between 3 and 10.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides further evidence that a high initial BI is the 
key risk factor for ENL. It also suggests that the difference between these two 
cohorts in their experience of ENL as demonstrated in this study, may be related 
to the different amounts of clofazimine which the two cohorts were given in the 
early years of their treatment. Further studies are needed to determine whether 
clofazimine could be used more specifically to reduce the severity of ENL in the 
small group of patients at high risk for the condition.

Episcleritis, scleritis, and anterior uveitis are common clinical manifestations 
of ocular leprosy. Erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) is an acute, exaggerated 
systemic immunological reaction that complicates the course of this chronic 
indolent disease. We present an ocular immunohistochemical study of severe form 
of ENL involving even the ciliary body and choroid resulting in the perforation 
of the globe on the initiation of anti leprosy therapy. We used CD-3, CD-68, 
S-100, and CD-20 for immunohistochemistry. It revealed plenty of CD-3-positive 
T-cells and CD-68-positive macrophages and a few S-100 and CD-20-positive cells. 
The inflammatory exudates stained positive for IgG and IgM. The diagnosis was 
ocular ENL.

Plant lignans and their microbial metabolites, e.g., enterolactone (ENL), may 
affect bile acid (BA) metabolism through interaction with hepatic receptors. We 
evaluated the effects of a flaxseed lignan extract (50 mg/day 
secoisolariciresinol diglucoside) compared to a placebo for 60 days each on 
plasma BA concentrations in 46 healthy men and women (20-45 years) using samples 
from a completed randomized, crossover intervention. Twenty BA species were 
measured in fasting plasma using LC-MS. ENL was measured in 24-h urines by 
GC-MS. We tested for (a) effects of the intervention on BA concentrations 
overall and stratified by ENL excretion; and (b) cross-sectional associations 
between plasma BA and ENL. We also explored the overlap in bacterial metabolism 
at the genus level and conducted in vitro anaerobic incubations of stool with 
lignan substrate to identify genes that are enriched in response to lignan 
metabolism. There were no intervention effects, overall or stratified by ENL at 
FDR < 0.05. In the cross-sectional analysis, irrespective of treatment, five 
secondary BAs were associated with ENL excretion (FDR < 0.05). In vitro analyses 
showed positive associations between ENL production and bacterial gene 
expression of the bile acid-inducible gene cluster and hydroxysteroid 
dehydrogenases. These data suggest overlap in community bacterial metabolism of 
secondary BA and ENL.

erythema nodosum leprosum reactions.

B-cells, in addition to antibody secretion, have emerged increasingly as 
effector and immunoregulatory cells in several chronic inflammatory diseases. 
Although Erythema Nodosum Leprosum (ENL) is an inflammatory complication of 
leprosy, the role of B- cell subsets has never been studied in this patient 
group. Therefore, it would be interesting to examine the contribution of B-cells 
in the pathogenesis of ENL. A case-control study design was used to recruit 30 
untreated patients with ENL and 30 non-reactional lepromatous leprosy (LL) 
patient controls at ALERT Hospital, Ethiopia. Peripheral blood samples were 
obtained before, during and after treatment from each patient. Peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated and used for immunophenotyping of B- 
cell subsets by flow cytometry. The kinetics of B-cells in patients with ENL 
before, during and after Prednisolone treatment of ENL was compared with LL 
patient controls as well as within ENL group. Total B-cells, mature B-cells and 
resting memory B-cells were not significantly different between patients with 
ENL reactions and LL controls before treatment. Interestingly, while the 
percentage of naive B-cells was significantly lower in untreated ENL patients 
than in LL patient controls, the percentage of activated memory B-cells was 
significantly higher in these untreated ENL patients than in LL controls. On the 
other hand, the percentage of tissue-like memory B-cells was considerably low in 
untreated ENL patients compared to LL controls. It appears that the lower 
frequency of tissue-like memory B-cells in untreated ENL could promote the 
B-cell/T-cell interaction in these patients through downregulation of inhibitory 
molecules unlike in LL patients. Conversely, the increased production of 
activated memory B-cells in ENL patients could imply the scale up of immune 
activation through antigen presentation to T-cells. However, the generation and 
differential function of these memory B-cells need further investigation. The 
finding of increased percentage of activated memory B-cells in untreated 
patients with ENL reactions suggests the association of these cells with the ENL 
pathology. The mechanism by which inflammatory reactions like ENL affecting 
these memory cells and contributing to the disease pathology is an interesting 
area to be explored for and could lead to the development of novel and highly 
efficacious drug for ENL treatment.

India.

BACKGROUND: Erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) classically presents as tender 
evanescent skin nodules involving extremities, trunk, and face but may appear at 
any site. Mucosal involvement in ENL is uncommon, and its occurrence over glans 
is extremely rare.
METHOD: We describe two interesting cases of ENL involving the glans penis and 
prepuce with different presentations.
RESULT: The first case had lepromatous leprosy with ENL with involvement of the 
glans penis in the form of a painful ulcer with necrotic slough. The second case 
had borderline lepromatous leprosy with ENL with involvement of glans in the 
form of a single painful nodule. Histopathology showed features of ENL, and 
Ziehl-Neelsen staining showed numerous acid fast bacilli.
CONCLUSION: We should be aware of genital involvement of ENL, which is a rare 
presentation and needs to be differentiated from other conditions requiring a 
different management approach.

BACKGROUND: Erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) is a debilitating multisystem 
disorder which complicates leprosy. It is characterised by fever, malaise and 
painful erythematous cutaneous nodules. ENL is often recurrent or chronic in 
nature and frequently severe. Patients often require prolonged treatment with 
high doses of oral corticosteroids. There are no data on the mortality 
associated with treated ENL.
METHODOLOGY: The notes of patients who were admitted, discharged, transferred to 
another facility or died with a diagnosis of leprosy or a leprosy-related 
complication for a five year period were reviewed.
RESULT/DISCUSSION: 414 individuals were identified from the ward database. 312 
(75.4%) patient records were located and reviewed. Ninety-nine individuals had 
ENL and 145 had a Type 1 reaction. The median age of individuals with ENLwas 25 
years. Eight patients with erythema nodosum leprosum died compared with two 
diagnosed with Type 1 reaction. This difference is statistically significant 
(p = 0.0168, Fisher's Exact Test). There is a significant mortality and 
morbidity associated with ENL in this Ethiopian cohort. The adverse outcomes 
seen are largely attributable to the chronic administration of oral 
corticosteroids used to control the inflammatory and debilitating symptoms of 
the condition.

BACKGROUND: Microbial metabolism of lignans from high-fiber plant foods produces 
bioactive enterolignans, such as enterolactone (ENL) and enterodiol (END). 
Enterolignan exposure influences cellular pathways important to cancer risk and 
is associated with reduced colon tumorigenesis in animal models and lower 
colorectal cancer risk in humans.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to test the effects of a flaxseed lignan 
supplement (50 mg secoisolariciresinol diglucoside/d) compared with placebo on 
host gene expression in colon biopsies and exfoliated colonocyte RNA in feces 
and fecal microbial community composition, and to compare responses in relation 
to ENL excretion.
METHODS: We conducted a 2-period randomized, crossover intervention in 42 
healthy men and women (20-45 y). We used RNA-seq to measure differentially 
expressed (DE) genes in colonic mucosa and fecal exfoliated cells through the 
use of edgeR and functional analysis with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. We used 
16S ribosomal RNA gene (V1-V3) analysis to characterize the fecal microbiome, 
and measured END and ENL in 24-h urine samples by gas chromatography-mass 
spectrometry.
RESULTS: We detected 32 DE genes (false discovery rate <0.05) in the exfoliome, 
but none in the mucosal biopsies, in response to 60 d of lignan supplement 
compared with placebo. Statistically significant associations were detected 
between ENL excretion and fecal microbiome measured at baseline and at the end 
of the intervention periods. Further, we detected DE genes in colonic mucosa and 
exfoliome between low- and high-ENL excreters. Analysis of biopsy samples 
indicated that several anti-inflammatory upstream regulators, including 
transforming growth factor β and interleukin 10 receptor, were suppressed in 
low-ENL excreters. Complementary analyses in exfoliated cells also suggested 
that low-ENL excreters may be predisposed to proinflammatory cellular events due 
to upregulation of nuclear transcription factor κB and NOS2, and an inhibition 
of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ network.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that ENL or other activities of the 
associated gut microbial consortia may modulate response to a dietary lignan 
intervention. This has important implications for dietary recommendations and 
chemoprevention strategies. This study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as 
NCT01619020.

The mechanism of hematopoietic progenitor cell immortalization by MLL-ENL.

University College London, United Kingdom.

The t(11;19) translocation gives rise to the MLL-ENL fusion protein and is 
frequently found in infant myeloid and lymphoid leukemias. Immortalized myeloid 
cell lines can be generated by expression of MLL-ENL in murine hematopoietic 
progenitors. By establishing myeloid cell lines with conditional expression of 
MLL-ENL, we recently demonstrated that MLL-ENL is necessary to maintain 
immortalization and sustain the expression of a characteristic pattern of Hox 
genes. The cell lines can be induced to undergo terminal differentiation by 
inhibition of MLL-ENL expression or by treatment with G-CSF. Expression of Hoxa 
genes is reduced in cells differentiating as a result of MLL-ENL loss, but is 
maintained in G-CSF treated cells. Thus, although aberrant maintenance of Hoxa 
gene expression may play an important role in MLL-ENL induced leukemia, the 
contribution of this pathway to immortalization is critically dependent on the 
cytokine environment of the immortalized myeloid cells.

BACKGROUND: Erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) is a systemic inflammatory 
complication occurring mainly in patients with lepromatous leprosy (LL) and 
borderline lepromatous leprosy (BL). Prednisolone is widely used for treatment 
of ENL reactions. However, it has been reported that prolonged treatment with 
prednisolone increases the risk for prednisolone-induced complications such as 
osteoporosis, diabetes, cataract and arteriosclerosis. It has been speculated 
that perhaps these complications result from lipid profile alterations by 
prednisolone. The effects of extended prednisolone treatment on lipid profiles 
in ENL patients have not been studied in leprosy patients with ENL reactions. 
Therefore, in this study we conducted a case-control study to investigate the 
changes in lipid profiles and serological responses in Ethiopian patients with 
ENL reaction after prednisolone treatment.
METHODS: A prospective matched case-control study was employed to recruit 30 
patients with ENL and 30 non-reactional LL patient controls at ALERT Hospital, 
Ethiopia. Blood samples were obtained from each patient with ENL reaction before 
and after prednisolone treatment as well as from LL controls. The serological 
host responses to PGL-1, LAM and Ag85 M. leprae antigens were measured by ELISA. 
Total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), high density lipoprotein (HDL) and 
low density lipoprotein (LDL) were measured by spectrophotometric method.
RESULTS: The host antibody response to M. leprae PGL-1, LAM and Ag85 antigens 
were significantly reduced in patients with ENL reactions compared to LL 
controls after treatment. Comparison between patients with acute and chronic ENL 
showed that host-response to PGL-1 was significantly reduced in chronic ENL 
after prednisolone treatment. Untreated patients with ENL reactions had low 
lipid concentration compared to LL controls. However, after treatment, both 
groups had comparable lipid profiles except for LDL, which was significantly 
higher in patients with ENL reaction. Comparison within the ENL group before and 
after treatment showed that prednisolone significantly increased LDL and HDL 
levels in ENL patients and this was more prominent in chronic ENL than in acute 
patients with ENL.
CONCLUSION: The significantly increased prednisolone-induced LDL and TG levels, 
particularly in patients with chronic ENL reactions, is a concern in the use of 
prednisolone for extended periods in ENL patients. The findings highlight the 
importance of monitoring lipid profiles during treatment of patients to minimize 
the long-term risk of prednisolone-induced complications.

Nepal.

A retrospective study of new borderline lepromatous and lepromatous patients 
reporting for multidrug therapy (MDT) for leprosy at the Anandaban Leprosy 
Hospital, Kathmandu, Nepal, over an 8-year period was conducted to determine the 
prevalence of erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL), the time and frequency of 
reactions, and clinical and laboratory parameters associated with ENL. An 
overall prevalence of ENL in this cohort of 19% was found. One third of these 
reactions occurred in patients before MDT was given, one third in the first 6 
months and one third after 6 months of treatment. Nearly 1 in 10 of the ENL 
reactions occurred in patients who had completed 2 years of MDT; 45% of patients 
with ENL had more than one episode. Data collected at the patients' first 
presentation was used to identify four major risk factors. Patients with 
lepromatous disease, skin infiltration or a bacterial index (BI) of > 4+ were at 
significantly increased risk. Patients older than 40 were at significantly 
decreased risk of ENL. There was a linear relationship in the risk of ENL with 
an increasing BI and an inverse relationship to increasing age. These 
observations should enable clinicians to recognize patients at first 
presentation who will be likely to develop ENL.

BACKGROUND: Chromosome translocations involving mixed lineage leukemia 1 (MLL1) 
cause acute leukemia in most infants and 5-10% children/adults with dismal 
clinical outcomes. Most frequent MLL1-fusion partners AF4/AFF4, AF9/ENL and ELL, 
together with CDK9/cyclin-T1, constitute super elongation complexes (SEC), which 
promote aberrant gene transcription, oncogenesis and maintenance of 
MLL1-rearranged (MLL1-r) leukemia. Notably, ENL, but not its paralog AF9, is 
essential for MLL1-r leukemia (and several other cancers) and therefore a drug 
target. Moreover, recurrent ENL mutations are found in Wilms tumor, the most 
common pediatric kidney cancer, and play critical roles in oncogenesis.
METHODS: Proteolysis-Targeting Chimera (PROTAC) molecules were designed and 
synthesized to degrade ENL. Biological activities of these compounds were 
characterized in cell and mouse models of MLL1-r leukemia and other cancers.
RESULTS: Compound 1 efficiently degraded ENL with DC50 of 37 nM and almost 
depleted it at ~ 500 nM in blood and solid tumor cells. AF9 (as well as other 
proteins in SEC) was not significantly decreased. Compound 1-mediated ENL 
reduction significantly suppressed malignant gene signatures, selectively 
inhibited cell proliferation of MLL1-r leukemia and Myc-driven cancer cells with 
EC50s as low as 320 nM, and induced cell differentiation and apoptosis. It 
exhibited significant antitumor activity in a mouse model of MLL1-r leukemia. 
Compound 1 can also degrade a mutant ENL in Wilms tumor and suppress its 
mediated gene transcription.
CONCLUSION: Compound 1 is a novel chemical probe for cellular and in vivo 
studies of ENL (including its oncogenic mutants) and a lead compound for further 
anticancer drug development.

OBJECTIVE: It was the aim of this study to evaluate the possible role of 
cytology in erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) and its use for early treatment of 
the disease.
STUDY DESIGN: We present a prospective study conducted with 15 clinically 
diagnosed ENL cases. Among them, 13 cases had previously been diagnosed with 
lepromatous leprosy (LL) and 2 patients were new LL cases with signs and 
symptoms of ENL lesions. Haematoxylin and eosin stain with modified 
Ziehl-Neelsen stain was performed on fine needle aspiration material. One case 
was sent for biopsy.
RESULTS: Complete cytological diagnosis of ENL was done in all 15 cases. 
Histopathological study revealed classical ENL lesions which also showed ENL 
features in cytodiagnosis.
CONCLUSION: In the past, the accurate mode of diagnosis of ENL lesions was 
histopathology. However, clinicians have to wait a long time for the report and 
generally they start treatment only on the basis of clinical signs and symptoms. 
Cytodiagnosis of ENL lesions is an early, effective method for accurate 
diagnosis and helps to initiate treatment for these painful lesions.

The leukemogenic fusion of MLL with ENL creates a novel transcriptional 
transactivator.

Erlangen, Germany.

Translocations affecting the chromosomal locus 11q23 are hallmarks of infant 
leukemias. These events disrupt the MLL gene (also ALL-1 or HRX) and fuse the 
MLL amino terminus in frame with a variety of unrelated proteins. The ENL gene 
on 19p13.1 is a recurrent fusion partner of MLL. Whereas potential functions 
have been suggested for isolated domains of either MLL or ENL no experimental 
data exist for the biological properties of the complete chimeric MLL-ENL 
protein. We show here that the fusion of MLL with ENL creates a novel molecule 
that is a potent general transcriptional transactivator in transient reporter 
gene assays. MLL-ENL strongly transactivated several unrelated promoters 
including the promoter of Hoxa7 a potential target gene for the unaltered MLL 
protein. This transactivation capability was cell type specific and it was 
critically dependent on the contributions of the methyltransferase-homology (MT) 
region of MLL in combination with the C-terminus of ENL. Squelching experiments 
and gel retardation studies identified the ENL C-terminus as a binding partner 
for an unknown factor and the MLL MT region as a unique general DNA binding 
motif. The potential implications of these findings for the leukemogenesis by 
MLL-ENL are discussed.

Amherst, NY, 14211, USA.
(2)Buffalo Public Schools, 84 Lorraine Avenue, Buffalo, NY, 14220, USA.

BACKGROUND: In this case study, multiple participants in a large urban school 
district used the Whole School, Whole Community, Whole Child (WSCC) model to 
guide development of a district wellness policy. The model's health education 
component is highlighted, focusing on concerns for special needs students and 
ones speaking English as a New Language (ENL).
METHODS: Organizational structure was developed around the WSCC model and 
district wellness policy implementation through coordination, collaboration, and 
communication (3Cs) of programs, policies, and processes/practices (3Ps).
RESULTS: The WSCC approach guided the creation of a district wellness policy 
that influenced programming for students with special needs and required Youth 
Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) data collection. Using YRBS and School Health Index 
(SHI) data in planning sexual health education illustrated improvements over 
time. Formation of the School Health and Wellness Collaborative under WSCC 
improved family engagement in sexual health education programs and practices. 
Relationships were established with community partners to impact student's 
sexual risk behaviors. Finally, the district co-created and implemented an 
evidenced-based sexual health curriculum, modifying it for special education and 
ENL students.
CONCLUSIONS: The WSCC approach is system changing. It takes time to develop the 
relationships vital to improve the 3Cs and 3Ps. Success is enhanced with a 
district wellness coordinator, the right people at the table, valid health data, 
and administrative and board support.

Enterolactone (ENL) is formed by the conversion of dietary precursors like 
strawberry lignans via the gut microbiota. Urinary concentrations of lignan 
metabolites are reported to be significantly associated with a lower risk of 
Type 2 diabetes (T2D). In the present study, antidiabetic effect of ENL and its 
modes of action were studied in vitro and in vivo employing a rat skeletal 
muscle-derived cell line, L6 myocytes in culture, and T2D model db/db mice. ENL 
dose-dependently increased glucose uptake in L6 myotubes under insulin absent 
condition. This increase by ENL was canceled by compound C, an inhibitor of 
5'-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (APMK). Activation 
(=phosphorylation) of AMPK and translocation of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) to 
plasma membrane in L6 myotubes were demonstrated by Western blotting analyses. 
Promotion by ENL of GLUT4 translocation to plasma membrane was also visually 
demonstrated by immunocytochemistry in L6 myoblasts that were transfected with 
glut4 cDNA-coding vector. T2D model db/db mice were fed the basal 20 % casein 
diet (20C) or 20C supplemented with ENL (0.001 or 0.01 %) for 6 weeks. Fasting 
blood glucose (FBG) levels were measured every week and intraperitoneal glucose 
tolerance test (IPGTT) was conducted. ENL at a higher dose (0.01 % in 20C) 
suppressed the increases in FBG levels. ENL was also demonstrated to improve the 
index of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and glucose intolerance by IPGTT in db/db 
mice. From these results, ENL is suggested to be an antidiabetic chemical entity 
converted from dietary lignans by gut microbiota.

MLL is fused to ENL or ELL in acute leukemias that contain t(ll;19)(q23;p13). 
Although ENL and ELL localize to chromosome 19, bands p13.3 and p13.1, 
respectively, these breakpoints are not always readily distinguished by standard 
cytogenetics. We therefore used reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction 
(RT-PCR) assays to analyze 26 cases of childhood acute leukemia containing 
t(11;19) to determine the frequencies of ENL and ELL involvement. All 17 cases 
of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) had MLL/ENL fusion transcripts. By 
contrast, of the 9 cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) analyzed, 6 had MLL/ENL 
fusions, 2 had MLL/ELL fusions, and 1 case had no RT-PCR-detectable MLL fusion 
mRNA. These data suggest that the majority of 11;19 translocations involve ENL, 
whereas involvement of ELL is relatively uncommon in childhood acute leukemia 
and may be restricted to AML.

Chromosome translocations involving the MLL gene are common rearrangements in 
leukemia. Such translocations fuse the MLL 5'-region to partner genes in frame, 
producing MLL-fusions that cause MLL-related leukemia. MLL-fusions activate 
transcription of target genes such as HoxA cluster and Meis1, but the underlying 
mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated. In this study, we discovered that 
Tip60, a MYST-type histone acetyltransferase, was required for the expression of 
HoxA cluster and Meis1 genes and the development of MLL-fusion leukemia. Tip60 
was recruited by MLL-AF10 and MLL-ENL fusions to the Hoxa9 locus, where it 
acetylated H2A.Z, thereby promoting Hoxa9 gene expression. Conditional deletion 
of Tip60 prevented the development of MLL-AF10 and MLL-ENL leukemia, indicating 
that Tip60 is indispensable for the leukemogenic activity of the MLL-AF10 and 
MLL-ENL-fusions. Our findings provide novel insight about epigenetic regulation 
in the development of MLL-AF10 and MLL-ENL-fusion leukemia.

OBJECTIVES: We wished to validate our recently devised 16-item ENLIST ENL 
Severity Scale, a clinical tool for measuring the severity of the serious 
leprosy associated complication of erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL). We also 
wished to assess the responsiveness of the ENLIST ENL Severity Scale in 
detecting clinical change in patients with ENL.
METHODS: Participants, recruited from seven centres in six leprosy endemic 
countries, were assessed using the ENLIST ENL Severity Scale by two researchers, 
one of whom categorised the severity of ENL. At a subsequent visit a further 
assessment using the scale was made and both participant and physician rated the 
change in ENL using the subjective categories of "Much better", "somewhat 
better", "somewhat worse" and "much worse" compared with "No change" or "about 
the same".
RESULTS: 447 participants were assessed with the ENLIST ENL Severity Scale. The 
Cronbach alpha of the scale and each item was calculated to determine the 
internal consistency of the scale. The ENLIST ENL Severity Scale had good 
internal consistency and this improved following removal of six items to give a 
Cronbach's alpha of 0.77. The cut off between mild ENL and more severe disease 
was 9 determined using ROC curves. The minimal important difference of the scale 
was determined to be 5 using both participant and physician ratings of change.
CONCLUSIONS: The 10-item ENLIST ENL Severity Scale is the first valid, reliable 
and responsive measure of ENL severity and improves our ability to assess and 
compare patients and their treatments in this severe and difficult to manage 
complication of leprosy. The ENLIST ENL Severity Scale will assist physicians in 
the monitoring and treatment of patients with ENL. The ENLIST ENL Severity Scale 
is easy to apply and will be useful as an outcome measure in treatment studies 
and enable the standardisation of other clinical and laboratory ENL research.

Continuous MLL-ENL expression is necessary to establish a "Hox Code" and

The t[(11;19)(p22;q23)] translocation, which gives rise to the MLL-ENL fusion 
protein, is commonly found in infant acute leukemias of both the myeloid and 
lymphoid lineage. To investigate the molecular mechanism of immortalization by 
MLL-ENL we established a Tet-regulatable system of MLL-ENL expression in primary 
hematopoietic progenitor cells. Immortalized myeloid cell lines were generated, 
which are dependent on continued MLL-ENL expression for their survival and 
proliferation. These cells either terminally differentiate or die when MLL-ENL 
expression is turned off with doxycycline. The expression profile of all 39 
murine Hox genes was analyzed in these cells by real-time quantitative PCR. This 
analysis showed that loss of MLL-ENL was accompanied by a reduction in the 
expression of multiple Hoxa genes. By comparing these changes with Hox gene 
expression in cells induced to differentiate with granulocyte colony-stimulating 
factor, we show for the first time that reduced Hox gene expression is specific 
to loss of MLL-ENL and is not a consequence of differentiation. Our data also 
suggest that the Hox cofactor Meis-2 can substitute for Meis-1 function. Thus, 
MLL-ENL is required to initiate and maintain immortalization of myeloid 
progenitors and may contribute to leukemogenesis by aberrantly sustaining the 
expression of a "Hox code" consisting of Hoxa4 to Hoxa11.

Erythema Nodosum Leprosum (ENL) is an immune reaction in leprosy that aggravates 
the patient´s clinical condition. ENL presents systemic symptoms of an acute 
infectious syndrome with high leukocytosis and intense malaise clinically 
similar to sepsis. The treatment of ENL patients requires immunosuppression and 
thus needs to be early and efficient to prevent both disabilities and permanent 
nerve damage. Some patients experience multiple episodes of ENL and prolonged 
use of immunosuppressive drugs may lead to serious adverse effects. Thalidomide 
treatment is extremely effective at ameliorating ENL symptoms. Several 
mechanisms have been proposed to explain the efficacy of thalidomide in ENL, 
including the inhibition of TNF production. Given its teratogenicity, 
thalidomide is prohibitive for women of childbearing age. A rational search for 
molecular targets during ENL episodes is essential to better understand the 
disease mechanisms involved, which may also lead to the discovery of new drugs 
and diagnostic tests. Previous studies have demonstrated that IFN-γ and GM-CSF, 
involved in the induction of CD64 expression, increase during ENL. The aim of 
the present study was to investigate CD64 expression during ENL and whether 
thalidomide treatment modulated its expression. Leprosy patients were allocated 
to one of five groups: (1) Lepromatous leprosy, (2) Borderline leprosy, (3) 
Reversal reaction, (4) ENL, and (5) ENL 7 days after thalidomide treatment. The 
present study demonstrated that CD64 mRNA and protein were expressed in ENL 
lesions and that thalidomide treatment reduced CD64 expression and neutrophil 
infiltrates-a hallmark of ENL. We also showed that ENL blood neutrophils 
exclusively expressed CD64 on the cell surface and that thalidomide diminished 
overall expression. Patient classification based on clinical symptoms found that 
severe ENL presented high levels of neutrophil CD64. Collectively, these data 
revealed that ENL neutrophils express CD64, presumably contributing to the 
immunopathogenesis of the disease.

Erythema nodosum leprosum in a general hospital.

Rea TH, Levan NE.

We report 32 patients with erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL). Twenty-two patients 
developed ENL before beginning chemotherapy. The recognition that ENL in the 
absence of chemotherapy is not an uncommon event is of importance, not simply as 
a fact in and of itself, but because this observation raises provocative 
questions when placed in the context of current ideas concerning ENL. ENL should 
be regarded as a manifestation of leprosy, not necessarily as a complication of 
its therapy.

t(11;19)(q23;p13.3); is one of the common chromosomal translocations in acute 
leukemias involving MLL rearrangements. This translocation generates MLL/ENL 
fusion transcripts. In a study of acute leukemias, 148 patients were identified 
to have MLL rearrangements by Southern blot analysis. Reverse 
transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay, using primer sets 
covering the 2 previously described breakpoints at exons 2 and 7 of ENL detected 
11 samples harboring MLL/ENL. complementary DNA panhandle PCR further identified 
4 additional cases with novel breakpoints in ENL at exon 4 or 6. Sequencing 
analysis showed that all novel fusion transcripts were in-frame. The 
conventional cytogenetic analysis failed to detect t(11;19) in 6 of 13 cases. Of 
15 patients with MLL/ENL, 7 had precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 4 
had T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and 4 had acute myeloid leukemia. The 
present study showed that PCR-based techniques are more sensitive than 
conventional karyotyping for detecting MLL/ENL fusions and an extra antisense 
primer at exon 6 of ENL should be included in RT-PCR assay to ensure complete 
detection of all MLL/ENL fusion transcripts.

Glomerulonephritis in leprosy.

Ng WL, Scollard DM, Hua A.

A renal biopsy from a patient with lepromatous leprosy but no history of 
erythrema nodosum leprosum (ENL) showed histologic, immunofluorescent, and 
ultrastructural features typical of immune-complex glomerulonephritis. A 
literature review found reports of 187 renal biopsies from leprosy patients, 
with glomerulonephritis in 31% of the cases, and a variety of other renal 
lesions. This accumulated evidence demonstrates that, contrary to widely held 
opinion, there is no association between glomerulonephritis and a history of 
ENL. Furthermore, it suggests that glomerulonephritis in leprosy patients has a 
similar incidence in lepromatous and non-lepromatous cases. These observations 
have an important bearing on concepts regarding the pathogenesis of immune 
complex glomerulonephritis in leprosy and the humoral immune mechanisms in 
patients with leprosy.

Chromosomal rearrangements affecting the MLL gene are associated with high-risk 
pediatric, adult and therapy-associated acute leukemia. In this study, 
conventional cytogenetic, fluorescence in situ hybridization, and molecular 
genetic studies were used to characterize the type and frequency of MLL 
rearrangements in a consecutive series of 45 Portuguese patients with 
MLL-related leukemia treated in a single institution between 1998 and 2011. In 
the group of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and an identified MLL 
fusion partner, 47% showed the presence of an MLL-AFF1 fusion, as a result of a 
t(4;11). In the remaining cases, a MLL-MLLT3 (27%), a MLL-MLLT1 (20%), or 
MLL-MLLT4 (7%) rearrangement was found. The most frequent rearrangement found in 
patients with acute myeloid leukemia was the MLL-MLLT3 fusion (42%), followed by 
MLL-MLLT10 (23%), MLL-MLLT1 (8%), MLL-ELL (8%), MLL-MLLT4 (4%), and MLL-MLLT11 
(4%). In three patients, fusions involving MLL and a septin family gene (SEPT2, 
SEPT6, and SEPT9), were identified. The most frequently identified chromosomal 
rearrangements were reciprocal translocations, but insertions and deletions, 
some cryptic, were also observed. In our series, patients with MLL 
rearrangements were shown to have a poor prognosis, regardless of leukemia 
subtype. Interestingly, children with 1 year or less showed a statistically 
significant better overall survival when compared with both older children and 
adults. The use of a combined strategy in the initial genetic evaluation of 
acute leukemia patients allowed us to characterize the pattern of MLL 
rearrangements in our institution, including our previous discovery of two novel 
MLL fusion partners, the SEPT2 and CT45A2 genes, and a very rare MLL-MLLT4 
fusion variant.

Memory T-cells, particularly, effector memory T cells are implicated in the 
pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases and may contribute to tissue injury and 
disease progression. Although erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) is an inflammatory 
complication of leprosy, the role of memory T cell subsets has never been 
studied in this patient group. The aim of this study was at investigate the 
kinetics of memory T cell subsets in patients with ENL before and after 
prednisolone treatment. A case-control study design was used to recruit 35 
untreated patients with ENL and 25 non-reactional lepromatous leprosy (LL) 
patient controls at ALERT Hospital, Ethiopia. Venous blood samples were obtained 
before, during, and after treatment from each patient. Peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated and used for immunophenotyping of T cell 
activation and memory T-cell subsets by flow cytometry. The kinetics of these 
immune cells in patients with ENL before and after treatment were compared with 
LL patient controls as well as within ENL cases at different time points. The 
median percentage of CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T-cells expressing activated T-cells 
were significantly higher in the PBMCs from patients with ENL than from LL 
patient controls before treatment. The median percentage of central and 
activated memory T-cells was significantly increased in patients with ENL 
compared to LL patient controls before treatment. Interestingly, patients with 
ENL had a lower percentage of naïve T cells (27.7%) compared to LL patient 
controls (59.5%) (P < 0.0001) before treatment. However, after prednisolone 
treatment, patients with ENL had a higher median percentage of naïve T-cells 
(43.0%) than LL controls (33.0%) (P < 0.001). The median percentage of activated 
T-cells (effector memory and effector T-cells) was significantly increased in 
patients with ENL (59.2%) before treatment compared to after treatment with 
prednisolone (33.9%) (P < 0.005). This is the first work which has shown T-cell 
activation and the different subsets of memory T cells in untreated patients 
with ENL. Consequently, this study delineates the role of T-cell activation in 
the pathogenesis of ENL reaction and challenges the long-standing dogma of 
immune complex as a sole etiology of ENL reaction.

Transcription is repressed if a DNA double-strand break (DSB) is introduced in 
close proximity to a transcriptional activation site at least in part by 
H2A-ubiquitination. While ATM signaling is involved, how it controls 
H2A-ubiquitination remains unclear. Here, we identify that, in response to DSBs, 
a transcriptional elongation factor, ENL (MLLT1), is phosphorylated by ATM at 
conserved SQ sites. This phosphorylation increases the interaction between ENL 
and the E3-ubiquitin-ligase complex of Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1) via 
BMI1. This interaction promotes enrichment of PRC1 at transcription elongation 
sites near DSBs to ubiquitinate H2A leading to transcriptional repression. ENL 
SQ sites and BMI1 are necessary for KU70 accumulation at DSBs near active 
transcription sites and cellular resistance to DSBs. Our data suggest that 
ATM-dependent phosphorylation of ENL functions as switch from elongation to 
Polycomb-mediated repression to preserve genome integrity.

Once abandoned because of devastating teratogenic effects, thalidomide has 
reemerged as an alternative treatment in many dermatologic diseases. In 1998, 
thalidomide became FDA approved for the acute treatment and suppression of the 
cutaneous manifestations of erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL). ENL is a systemic 
disorder that typically occurs after several years of antileprosy treatments, 
usually for lepromatous leprosy. Off-label uses for thalidomide include: 
aphthous stomatitis, Behçet disease, pyoderma gangrenosum, chronic discoid lupus 
erythematosus, systemic lupus erythematosus, lichen planus, prurigo nodularis 
and sarcoidosis. This review examines the background, pharmacokinetics, 
mechanism of action, side-effects, and indications of thalidomide.

Mumbai, India.

BACKGROUND: Lepra reactions are not always diagnosable under the microscope. We 
analyzed skin histopathology in 64 cases of lepra reaction.
AIM: To make detailed observations on histopathologic features of type 1 and 
type 2 lepra reaction (erythema nodosum leprosum, ENL).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective study, we included 64 patients 
diagnosed during a 3-year period as lepra reaction based on clinico-pathological 
co-relation.
RESULTS: Out of the 64 patients, 22 were of type 1 reaction and 42 of ENL. The 
most consistent finding in type 1 reaction was papillary dermal edema (86%) 
followed by pyknosis of lymphocytes (77%) and intercellular edema within 
granuloma (73%). Surprisingly, folliculotropism of lymphocytes was seen in 55% 
and subcutaneous infiltration in 36%. In ENL, the most common finding was 
presence of neutrophils within the granuloma (100%), followed by leukocytoclasia 
(81%), papillary dermal edema (81%), and neutrophilic panniculitis (69%). Fibrin 
in the vessel wall or/and granulomas was noted in only 38% while fibrin thrombi 
in the vessel walls were seen in only 12% of cases.
CONCLUSION: Infiltration of macrophage granulomas by neutrophils is a reliable 
sign of ENL. Classical signs of vasculitis are not always present in ENL. 
Folliculotropism and lymphocytic panniculitis were frequent in type 1 reactions 
while neutrophilic panniculitis was common with ENL.

BACKGROUND: Erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) classically presents with tender, 
coppery, evanescent nodules along with constitutional features and visceral 
involvement. However, uncommon morphological variants of ENL-like erythema 
nodosum necroticans, erythema multiforme (EM)-like ENL, Sweet's syndrome 
(SS)-like ENL, Lucio phenomenon, and reactive perforating type of ENL have also 
been described in the literature. The primary objective of this study was to 
describe the clinical features of the severe and uncommon morphological variants 
of ENL.
METHODS: This was an observational case series with retrospective review of 
records of all ENL patients with ulceronecrotic lesions admitted in the 
Department of Dermato-venereo-leprology of a tertiary health center of central 
India over a period of 2 years.
RESULTS: Eighteen patients were included, all of whom had ulceronecrotic 
lesions. Four out of them had EM like ENL, two had SS-like presentation, and one 
of them had annular bullous lesions over old infiltrated plaques of leprosy.
CONCLUSIONS: Uncommon variants of ENL can be very commonly misdiagnosed in 
patients, especially in those who have not been previously diagnosed with 
leprosy. Hence, a high index of suspicion is required in such cases to avoid 
delay in the diagnosis and resulting morbidity.

Erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) is a severe multisystem immune mediated 
complication of borderline lepromatous leprosy and lepromatous leprosy. ENL is 
associated with skin lesions, neuritis, arthritis, dactylitis, eye inflammation, 
osteitis, orchitis, lymphadenitis and nephritis. The treatment of ENL requires 
immunosuppression, which is often required for prolonged periods of time and may 
lead to serious adverse effects. ENL and its treatment is associated with 
increased mortality and economic hardship. Improved, evidence-based treatments 
for ENL are needed; however, defining the severity of ENL and outcome measures 
for treatment studies is difficult because of the multiple organ systems 
involved. A cross-sectional study was performed, by the members of the Erythema 
Nodosum Leprosum International STudy (ENLIST) Group, of patients with ENL 
attending seven leprosy referral centres in Brazil, Ethiopia, India, Nepal, the 
Philippines and the United Kingdom. We systematically documented the clinical 
features and type of ENL, its severity and the drugs used to treat it. Patients 
with chronic ENL were more likely to be assessed as having severe ENL. Pain, the 
most frequent symptom, assessed using a semi-quantitative scale was 
significantly worse in individuals with "severe" ENL. Our findings will 
determine the items to be included in a severity scale of ENL which we are 
developing and validating. The study also provides data on the clinical features 
of ENL, which can be incorporated into a definition of ENL and used for outcome 
measures in treatment studies.

BACKGROUND: Metabolism and excretion of the phytoestrogen enterolactone (ENL), 
which has been associated with breast cancer risk, may be affected by variation 
in steroid hormone and xenobiotic-metabolizing genes.
METHODS: We conducted a randomized, crossover flaxseed intervention study in 252 
healthy, postmenopausal women [137 European ancestry (EA) and 115 African 
ancestry (AA)] from western New York. Participants were randomly assigned to 
maintain usual diet or consume 10 g/day ground flaxseed for 6 weeks. After a 
2-month washout period, participants crossed over to the other diet condition 
for an additional 6 weeks. Urinary ENL excretion was measured by gas 
chromatography-mass spectrometry and 70 polymorphisms in 29 genes related to 
steroid hormone and xenobiotic metabolism were genotyped. Mixed additive genetic 
models were constructed to examine association of genetic variation with urinary 
ENL excretion at baseline and after the flaxseed intervention.
RESULTS: SNPs in several genes were nominally (P < 0.05) associated with ENL 
excretion at baseline and/or after intervention: ESR1, CYP1B1, COMT, CYP3A5, 
ARPC1A, BCL2L11, SHBG, SLCO1B1, and ZKSCAN5. A greater number of SNPs were 
associated among AA women than among EA women, and no SNPs were associated in 
both races. No SNP-ENL associations were statistically significant after 
correction for multiple comparisons.
CONCLUSIONS: Variation in several genes related to steroid hormone metabolism 
was associated with lignan excretion at baseline and/or after flaxseed 
intervention among postmenopausal women.
IMPACT: These findings may contribute to our understanding of the differences 
observed in urinary ENL excretion among AA and EA women and thus hormone-related 
breast cancer risk.

AbstractErythema nodosum leprosum (ENL), also known as type II leprosy reaction, 
is a severe immune-mediated complication of multibacillary leprosy. For ENL, 
corticosteroids and thalidomide are the mainstays of treatment. Other 
immunosuppressants, such as clofazimine, cyclosporine, and azathioprine have 
also been used. Although most patients with ENL respond well to conventional 
treatments, a small number are refractory to these therapies and have severe 
morbidity or mortality. We report the case of a 24-year-old man with refractory 
ENL treated with high-dose corticosteroids for 15 months. The patient developed 
steroid-dependence and serious adverse effects, and died of an intracranial 
infection.

BACKGROUND: Corticosteroids remain the main therapy in erythema nodosum leprosum 
(ENL), and long-term usage in chronic or recurrent ENL is a cause of significant 
morbidity and mortality. Thalidomide exerts dramatic effect in controlling ENL 
and helps reduce the dose of steroids, but the cost is a hindrance to its usage.
METHODS: Patients of ENL (steroid naïve and steroid-dependent) were recruited 
over a 1-year period. An escalating dose of low-dose thalidomide with a reducing 
dose of prednisolone was titrated depending on the control of disease activity. 
The primary aim was to reduce the dose of steroids to the lowest effective dose, 
and the secondary aim was to stop.
RESULTS: Sixteen patients of ENL were studied (mean duration of ENL 22.1 months, 
15 severe ENL), and a majority (11/16, 68%) were on steroids with a mean 
duration of 11.27 months. All patients had steroid-related side effects 
(cushingoid habitus 81.8%, weight gain 54.5%, diabetes mellitus 9%, 
hyperlipidemia 18.18%, cataract 18.1%, osteoporosis 36.3%, striae 36.3%, 
acneiform eruptions 18.1%, and myopathy 9%). Steroids could be tapered in a 
majority of patients (n = 9) within 3 months (mean 2.44 months) with a low dose 
of thalidomide (25-150 mg/day, mean 78.3 mg) achieving a significant reduction 
in prednisolone dose (33.16 mg at baseline; 4.28 mg at 3 months, P < 0.05). 
Steroids could be stopped in 92% of patients by 3.03 months, and both drugs 
could be stopped in 80% of cases by 5.83 months.
CONCLUSION: The rapid and effective control of ENL with low-dose thalidomide in 
our series is comparable to the historical efficacy of high-dose thalidomide 
regimens, making it an affordable therapy in resource-constrained settings and 
an excellent steroid-sparing agent. The rapid onset of disease control is likely 
attributable to its action via neutrophils.

High-fiber plant foods contain lignans that are converted to bioactive 
enterolignans, enterolactone (ENL) and enterodiol (END) by gut bacteria. 
Previously, we conducted an intervention study to gain mechanistic insight into 
the potential chemoprotective effects of flaxseed lignan supplementation 
(secoisolariciresinol diglucoside; SDG) compared to a placebo in 42 men and 
women. Here, we expand on these analyses to further probe the impact of the 
microbial metabolite phenotype on host gene expression in response to lignan 
exposure. We defined metabolic phenotypes as high- or low-ENL excretion based on 
the microbial metabolism of SDG. RNA-seq was used to assess host gene expression 
in fecal exfoliated cells. Stratified by microbial ENL excretion, differentially 
expressed (DE) genes in high- and low-ENL excreter groups were compared. Linear 
discriminant analysis using the ENL phenotypes identified putative biomarker 
combinations of genes capable of discriminating the lignan treatment from the 
placebo. Following lignan intervention, a total of 165 DE genes in high-ENL 
excreters and 1450 DE genes in low-ENL excreters were detected. Functional 
analysis identified four common upstream regulators (master genes): CD3, IFNG, 
IGF1 and TNFRSF1A. Our findings suggest that the enhanced conversion of flaxseed 
lignan to ENL is associated with a suppressed inflammatory status.

MLL fusion proteins are oncogenic transcription factors that are associated with 
aggressive lymphoid and myeloid leukemias. We constructed an inducible MLL 
fusion, MLL-ENL-ERtm, that rendered the transcriptional and transforming 
properties of MLL-ENL strictly dependent on the presence of 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen. 
MLL-ENL-ERtm-immortalized hematopoietic cells required 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen for 
continuous growth and differentiated terminally upon tamoxifen withdrawal. 
Microarray analysis performed on these conditionally transformed cells revealed 
Hoxa9 and Hoxa7 as well as the Hox coregulators Meis1 and Pbx3 among the targets 
upregulated by MLL-ENL-ERtm. Overexpression of the Hox repressor Bmi-1 inhibited 
the growth-transforming activity of MLL-ENL. Moreover, the enforced expression 
of Hoxa9 in combination with Meis1 was sufficient to substitute for MLL-ENL-ERtm 
function and to maintain a state of continuous proliferation and differentiation 
arrest. These results suggest that MLL fusion proteins impose a reversible block 
on myeloid differentiation through aberrant activation of a limited set of 
homeobox genes and Hox coregulators that are consistently expressed in 
MLL-associated leukemias.

Enterolactone (ENL) and enterodiol (END) are mammalian lignans derived from the 
plant lignans matairesionol (MAT), secoisolariciresinol (SECO), and other 
dietary precursors. ENL was found to undergo extensive glucuronidation with 
rhesus liver microsomes to form O-glucuronides at both phenolic hydroxy groups. 
In addition to glucuronidation, ENL was found to be a good substrate for 
oxidative metabolism. The major products had a m/z of 313 or 295 by LC-MS 
analysis in negative ion mode and were determined to be products of 
monohydroxylation of ENL. The m/z 295 products were the result of a dehydration 
of the m/z 313 in the MS source. Addition of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) to the NADPH 
incubations resulted in a decrease of at least 2 major monohydroxylated products 
and the formation of a major and several minor new products with a m/z of 474. 
The major adduct was isolated, purified for NMR, and confirmed to be the NAC 
adduct of the ENL catechol. Incubations of ENL with liver microsomes containing 
UDPGA, NADPH, and NAC resulted in the formation of ENL-glucuronides; no NAC 
adducts were detected by LC-MS. Incubations of ENL with human and rhesus 
hepatocytes resulted in several metabolites. The major metabolites in 
hepatocytes were the glucuronic acid conjugates; minor amounts of the sulfate 
conjugate(s) and monohydroxylated products were also detected by LC-MS. 
Glutathione or other thiol adducts were not detected in hepatocytes. Conclusion. 
The high efficiency and specificity for the glucuronidation of ENL decrease its 
potential toxicity via CYP450 bioactivation.

differentiation.

The translocation t(11;19) is a recurrent feature of a subgroup of acute 
leukemias occurring in infants. This event fuses the genes MLL and ENL and 
creates the leukemogenic oncoprotein MLL-ENL. We studied the effect of 
retroviral MLL-ENL expression in primary mouse hematopoietic cells and show here 
that MLL-ENL requires the oncoprotein Myc to establish a reversible 
differentiation arrest of a myelomonocytic precursor population. 
MLL-ENL-transduced cells proliferated as immature myeloid cells in the presence 
of interleukin 3. The addition of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor reversed 
the maturation block set by MLL-ENL and induced the development of mature 
granulocytes and macrophages accompanied by growth arrest. Gene expression 
analysis indicated a down-regulation of the proto-oncogene c-myc and of several 
c-myc target genes during granulocyte colony-stimulating factor-mediated 
differentiation. The role of c-myc in the MLL-ENL transformation pathway was 
tested by modulating the effective Myc protein concentrations in MLL-ENL 
transduced cells. Cotransduction of dominant-negative Myc neutralized the 
MLL-ENL effect and precluded transformation. In contrast, constitutive 
expression of Myc cooperated with MLL-ENL and caused the transformation of a 
cell population with an irreversible maturation arrest.

Endoscopic nephrolithotomy for the removal of complicated nephroliths in dogs 
and cats: 16 kidneys in 12 patients (2005-2017).

Petrovsky B, Berent AC, Weisse CW, Branter E, Bagley DH, Lamb KE.

OBJECTIVE: To describe techniques and outcomes for dogs and cats undergoing 
endoscopic nephrolithotomy (ENL) for the removal of complicated nephroliths.
ANIMALS: 11 dogs and 1 cat (n = 16 renal units) with complicated nephroliths 
that underwent ENL via a surgically assisted ENL approach (12 renal units) or a 
percutaneous nephrolithotomy approach (4 renal units) between December 2005 and 
June 2017.
PROCEDURES: Data were obtained from the medical records regarding preoperative, 
operative, and postoperative findings. Follow-up information on complications 
and outcomes was also collected.
RESULTS: Indications for nephrolith removal included massive calculi displacing 
parenchyma (n = 7), recurrent urinary tract infections (5), and ureteral outflow 
obstruction (4). Median nephrolith diameter was 2.5 cm (range, 0.5 to 5.7 cm). 
Nephrolith composition differed among patients; calcium oxalate was the most 
common type (n = 7 [including 2 mixed nephroliths containing ≥ 60% calcium 
oxalate]). Following ENL (median duration, 180 minutes), 15 of 16 renal units 
were completely nephrolith free. Procedure-related complications included renal 
puncture-associated hemorrhage requiring a blood transfusion (n = 1), renal 
capsule tear (1), and ureteral puncture (1); all were managed without adverse 
consequence. Five of 12 patients remained alive at the final follow-up (median, 
557 days after ENL), and none died from the procedure.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: ENL as performed was safe and effective in 
removing complicated nephroliths in a renal-sparing manner for the patients in 
this study. This procedure requires technical training and could be considered 
for the treatment of complicated nephrolithiasis in dogs and possibly cats.

Thalidomide is used for the acute treatment and suppression of the cutaneous 
manifestations of erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL). In this study, comparisons 
were made regarding the plasma concentrations of thalidomide in patients with 
ENL on the course or after leprosy therapy in a prospective clinical trial. 
Thalidomide concentrations were measured by liquid chromatography on days 1, 3, 
and 14 of treatment. After 100 mg/d, the thalidomide concentrations ranged from 
0.82 to 1.03 and 0.43 to 0.80 microg/mL, on the course or after leprosy therapy, 
respectively. No differences were observed in thalidomide concentrations between 
and within the groups. Our results suggested that leprosy multidrug therapy does 
not seem to affect the plasma concentrations of thalidomide in patients with 
ENL.

Erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) is a severe immune reaction commonly encountered 
as a complication in patients with multibacillary leprosy. Management of chronic 
ENL in leprosy is challenging and necessitates the use of systemic 
immunosuppressants, including corticosteroids and thalidomide. No single drug is 
universally effective and most current therapeutic agents carry a significant 
risk of systemic toxicity. Apremilast is an orally effective phosphodiesterase-4 
inhibitor with a potent immunomodulatory action and is clinically effective in 
inflammatory conditions like chronic plaque psoriasis. We report two patients 
with poorly controlled chronic ENL, despite the use of multiple therapeutic 
agents. Both patients demonstrated significant clinical improvement with 
apremilast, without any adverse effects, thereby suggesting its potential as a 
novel therapeutic option in chronic ENL. What's already known about this topic? 
Erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) is an immune-mediated reaction in patients with 
multibacillary leprosy, with chronicity and recurrences frequently reported. 
Management of chronic ENL requires systemic immunosuppressants like 
corticosteroids, which may not be universally effective and carry a risk of 
serious toxicity. Apremilast is an oral immunomodulator with good efficacy in 
inflammatory conditions like chronic plaque psoriasis. What does this study? 
Apremilast may be an effective therapeutic agent in patients with chronic ENL.

FLT3 is one of the most frequently mutated genes in acute leukemias. However, 
the role in leukemogenesis of wild-type (wt) FLT3, which is highly expressed in 
many hematologic malignancies, is unclear. We show here that in mouse models 
established by retroviral transduction of leukemic fusion proteins, deletion of 
Flt3 strongly inhibits MLL-ENL and to lesser extent p210(BCR-ABL)-induced 
leukemogenesis, but has no effect in MLL-AF9 or AML1-ETO9a models. Flt3 acts at 
the level of leukemic stem cells (LSCs), as a fraction of LSCs in MLL-ENL, but 
not in MLL-AF9-induced leukemia, expressed Flt3 in vivo, and Flt3 expression on 
LSCs was associated with leukemia development in this model. Furthermore, 
efficiency of MLL-ENL, but not of MLL-AF9-induced leukemia induction was 
significantly enhanced after transduction of Flt3(+) compared to Flt3(-) wt 
myeloid progenitors. However, Flt3 is not required for immortalization of bone 
marrow cells in vitro by MLL-ENL and does not affect colony formation by MLL-ENL 
LSCs in vitro, suggesting that in vitro models do not reflect the in vivo 
biology of MLL-ENL leukemia with respect to Flt3 requirement. We conclude that 
wt Flt3 plays a role in leukemia initiation in vivo, which is, however, not 
universal.

ENL reactions in the multibacillary cases of the AMFES cohort in central 
Ethiopia: incidence and risk factors.

Erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL), or type 2 leprosy reactions are an important 
complication of multibacillary leprosy. The AMFES cohort includes 300 new 
multibacillary cases that have been followed for up to 10 years from the start 
of treatment, in central Ethiopia. Sixteen (5.3%) patients had ENL reactions. 
The incidence of ENL was maximal in the second and third years after the start 
of treatment, reaching 6.9 episodes per 100 person years at risk. Factors 
associated with being lepromatous [LL classification and a high bacillary index 
(BI)] gave an increased risk of developing ENL; in the univariate analysis, LL 
classification gave a relative risk of 3.6 (95% CI 1.3-10) and a BI of 6 gave a 
relative risk of 8.6 (95% CI 2.3-32) for the development of ENL. HIV 
co-infection was found to be a risk factor in this cohort, but as the numbers 
involved are small (only two HIV positive patients had ENL), this finding must 
be confirmed in larger studies. Ten of the 16 cases had recurrent episodes and 
five had at least five episodes occurring over a period of more than 2 years. 
The management and prognosis of ENL reactions are discussed.

Dysfunction of AML1/Runx1, a transcription factor, plays a crucial role in the 
development of many types of leukemia. Additional events are often required for 
AML1 dysfunction to induce full-blown leukemia; however, a mechanistic basis of 
their cooperation is still elusive. Here, we investigated the effect of AML1 
deficiency on the development of MLL-ENL leukemia in mice. Aml1 excised bone 
marrow cells lead to MLL-ENL leukemia with shorter duration than Aml1 intact 
cells in vivo. Although the number of MLL-ENL leukemia-initiating cells is not 
affected by loss of AML1, the proliferation of leukemic cells is enhanced in 
Aml1-excised MLL-ENL leukemic mice. We found that the enhanced proliferation is 
the result of repression of p19(ARF) that is directly regulated by AML1 in 
MLL-ENL leukemic cells. We also found that down-regulation of p19(ARF) induces 
the accelerated onset of MLL-ENL leukemia, suggesting that p19(ARF) is a major 
target of AML1 in MLL-ENL leukemia. These results provide a new insight into a 
role for AML1 in the progression of leukemia.

Brain angiotensin-converting enzyme activity and autonomic regulation in heart

52242, USA.

Several recent studies suggest an important role for the brain renin-angiotensin 
system in the pathogenesis of heart failure. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 
activity and binding of angiotensin type 1 (AT1) receptors, which mediate the 
central effects of ANG II, are increased in heart failure. The present study 
examined the relationship between brain ACE activity and the autonomic 
dysregulation characteristic of rats with congestive heart failure. Rats with 
heart failure (HF) induced by coronary artery ligation and sham-operated control 
(SHAM) rats were treated with chronic (28 days) third cerebral ventricle 
[intracerebroventricular (ICV)] or intraperitoneal (IP) infusion of a low dose 
of the ACE inhibitor enalaprilat (ENL) or vehicle (VEH). VEH-treated HF rats had 
increased sodium consumption, reduced urine sodium and urine volume, and 
increased sympathetic nerve activity with impaired baroreflex regulation. These 
responses were minimized or prevented by ICV ENL started 24 h after coronary 
ligation. IP ENL at the low dose used in these studies had no beneficial effects 
on HF rats. Neither IP nor ICV ENL had any substantial effect on the SHAM rats. 
The findings confirm a critically important contribution of the brain 
renin-angiotensin system to the pathophysiology of congestive heart failure.

Evidence from preclinical and animal studies demonstrated an anticancer effect 
of flaxseed lignans, particularly enterolactone (ENL), against prostate cancer. 
However, extensive first-pass metabolism following oral lignan consumption 
results in their systemic availability primarily as glucuronic acid conjugates 
(ENL-Gluc) and their modest in vivo effects. To overcome the unfavorable 
pharmacokinetics and improve their effectiveness in prostate cancer, 
antibody-directed enzyme prodrug therapy (ADEPT) might offer a novel strategy to 
allow for restricted activation of ENL from circulating ENL-Gluc within the 
tumor environment. The anti-prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) antibody 
D7 was fused with human β-glucuronidase (hβG) via a flexible linker. The binding 
property of the fusion construct, D7-hβG, against purified or cell surface PSMA 
was determined by flow cytometry and Octet Red 384 system, respectively, with a 
binding rate constant, K d, of 2.5 nM. The enzymatic activity of D7-hβG was 
first tested using the probe, 4-methylumbelliferone glucuronide. A 3.8-fold 
greater fluorescence intensity was observed at pH 4.5 at 2 h compared with pH 
7.4. The ability of D7-hβG to activate ENL from ENL-Gluc was tested and detected 
using LC-MS/MS. Enhanced generation of ENL was observed with increasing ENL-Gluc 
concentrations and reached 3613.2 ng/mL following incubation with 100 μM 
ENL-Gluc at pH 4.5 for 0.5 h. D7-hβG also decreased docetaxel IC50 value from 
23 nM to 14.9 nM in C4-2 cells. These results confirmed the binding and activity 
of D7-hβG and additional in vitro investigation is needed to support the future 
possibility of introducing this ADEPT system to animal models.

Feeding flaxseed to dairy cows can modulate gene expression and PG synthesis in 
the uterus at the time of peri-implantation. The objectives of the present study 
were to determine which flaxseed components are responsible for these effects 
and how different endometrial cell types are affected. We evaluated the effects 
of six different linoleic acid (n-6):α-linolenic acid (n-3) ratios and three 
concentrations of the lignan enterolactone (ENL) on endometrial stromal cells 
(SC) and epithelial cells (EC). The mRNA abundance of genes with known or 
suspected roles in embryo survival or PG synthesis was evaluated, along with 
PGE2 and PGF2α concentrations in culture media. The mRNA abundance of several 
genes was modulated by different fatty acid (FA) ratios and/or ENL, and this 
modulation differed between cell types. The FA4 (FA at an n-6:n-3 ratio of 4) 
treatment (rich in n-3 FA) increased the mRNA abundance of genes that have 
positive effects on uterine receptivity and implantation when compared with the 
FA25 (FA at an n-6:n-3 ratio of 25) treatment (rich in n-6 FA). ENL decreased 
PGE2 and PGF2α concentrations in both cell types, and this reduction was 
associated with lower mRNA abundance of the PG synthase genes AKR1B1 and PTGES 
in SC. The combination of ENL with FA (FA4 treatment) resulted in the greatest 
reduction in PGF2α concentrations when compared with the addition of FA (FA4) or 
ENL alone. Because of the known luteolytic properties of PGF2α, a reduction in 
endometrial PGF2α secretion would favour the establishment and maintenance of 
pregnancy.

BACKGROUND: The magnitude of diagnostic abnormalities can influence the 
perception of clinical outcome. Extreme neutrophilic leukocytosis (ENL) is an 
uncommon finding caused by markedly increased granulopoiesis. A lack of recent, 
large-scale studies limits our understanding of the importance, causation, and 
prognosis associated with ENL in dogs.
HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: Describe disease categories (DC) identified in dogs with 
ENL and identify variables associated with survival. We hypothesized that 
factors including fever, segmented and band neutrophil counts, and DC would be 
negatively associated with survival.
ANIMALS: Two-hundred sixty-nine dogs with ENL (segmented neutrophils ≥50 × 103 
 cells/μL) presented to the veterinary teaching hospitals at Auburn University 
(n = 164), the University of Missouri (n = 81), and Oklahoma State University 
(n = 24) between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2019.
METHODS: Retrospective study. Demographic data and outcome variables including 
temperature, CBC findings, DC, duration of hospitalization (DOH) and outcome 
were acquired from the medical record. Statistical analyses included chi-squared 
and Kruskal-Wallis tests, and Pearson product moment correlations with a P < .05 
significance level.
RESULTS: Mortality was 41%. Survival differed with DC (P = .002). Mortality was 
higher (P < .05) in dogs with neoplasia (56.2%) vs immune-mediated disease 
(20.5%) or tissue damage/necrosis (19%). Weight (P = .001, r = -0.14) and total 
neutrophil count (P = .04, r = -0.02) were weakly negatively associated with 
survival whereas DOH was weakly positively associated with survival (P = .03, 
r = 0.14).
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Mortality in dogs with ENL is high but 
differed according to DC. Only weak correlations between clinical or 
clinicopathologic variables and mortality were identified. Extreme neutrophilic 
leukocytosis should be interpreted in conjunction with the underlying disease 
process, and not broadly used to predict clinical outcome.

Rearrangements involving the mixed lineage leukemia gene (MLL) are found in the 
majority of leukemias that develop within the first year of age, known as infant 
leukemias, and likely originate during prenatal life. MLL rearrangements are 
also present in about 10% of other pediatric and adult acute myeloid leukemia 
(AML) and acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL). These translocations and others 
occurring in early life are associated with a dismal prognosis compared with 
adult leukemias carrying the same translocations. This observation suggests that 
infant and adult leukemias are biologically distinct but the underlying 
molecular mechanisms for these differences are not understood. In this work, we 
induced the same MLL chromosomal translocation in the embryo at the time of 
fetal liver hematopoiesis and in the adult hematopoietic tissues to develop 
disease models in mice that recapitulate human infant and adult leukemias, 
respectively. We successfully obtained myeloid leukemia in adult mice after 
MLL-ENL recombination induction using the interferon inducible Mx1-Cre line. 
Using this same Cre line, we generated embryonic MLL-ENL leukemias, which were 
more aggressive than the corresponding adult leukemias. In conclusion, we have 
developed a novel MLL-ENL embryonic leukemia model in mice that can be used to 
study some aspects of infant leukemia ontogeny.

[Phytoestrogenis properties of flaxseed lignans].

[Article in Russian]

Martinchik AN, Zubtsov VV.

The analysis of experimental, clinical and epidemiological data on the 
phytoestrogen properties of the components of flaxseed Linum Usitatissimum L., 
especially lignans and products of their biotransformation in humans and animals 
enterodiol (END) and enterolactone (ENL) are presented. Flaxseed is the richest 
in the vegetable world source of lignans (up to 0,7-1,5% of dry weight of seed), 
among which prevails secoisolariciresinol diglycoside (SIR-DG). Plant lignans 
are characterized as natural phytoestrogen that reduce the risk of 
hormonedependent cancers of breast, uterus and prostate. Anticancerogenic 
activity of flaxseed lignans due to antioxudant effect END and ENL in the human 
body. The antioxidant activity of SIR, END, ENL and SIR-DG is higher than that 
of vitamin E and the antioxidant activity of SIR, END and ENL higher than 
SIR-DG. On the basis of evidence-based biomedical researches on various models 
in experimental carcinogenesis, on the tumor cells in vitro, in clinical trials 
in patients with hormone-dependent tumors, and, finally, in epidemiological 
studies have proved the anticarcinogenic activity of the components of the 
flaxseed and validity of recommendations for preventive and curative use in 
hormone-dependent tumors.

BACKGROUND & AIM: The mammalian lignan enterolactone (ENL) produced from plant 
lignans, e. g. secoisolariciresinol diglycoside (SDG), may protect against 
various cancers in humans. The present work aims to evaluate the effect of 
flaxseed on tumour formation in multiple intestinal neoplasia (Min) mice, a 
model for colon tumorigenesis.
DESIGN: Male and female Min mice were fed either with a non-fibre control diet 
or the same diet supplemented with 0.5 % (w/w) defatted flaxseed meal. 
Conversion of SDG to the mammalian lignans enterodiol (END) and ENL in the gut, 
and plasma ENL, were measured by HPLC with coulometric electrode array detector 
(CEAD) and timeresolved fluoroimmunoassay, respectively. Wild-type mice were 
also fed with the experimental diets in order to see whether lignan metabolism 
is different in Min and wild-type mice.
RESULTS: The total number of adenomas or their size in the small intestine was 
not different in the flaxseed and control groups. The flaxseed group had a 
tendency for a decreased number of colon adenomas in both genders. Gender and 
genotype based differences were found in the intestinal ENL levels. When 
compared to Min females, Min males in the flaxseed group had several fold higher 
ENL levels in the small intestine (Min males 125 +/- 124.5 nmol/g vs. females 
22.8 +/- 16.0 nmol/g, P = 0.048) and caecum (47.6 +/- 31.6 nmol/g vs. females 
14.5 +/- 6.6 nmol/g, P = 0.001). Presence of adenomas in the gut influences the 
intestinal lignan metabolism. Min mice had less intestinal END and ENL as 
compared with the wild-type mice (P < 0.05). Mean plasma ENL increased 7-fold 
during the flaxseed feeding (7 nmol/L in control vs. 50 nmol/L in flaxseed 
group) but no differences between gender and genotype were found. The plasma ENL 
level did not correlate with adenoma number in the small intestine and colon.
CONCLUSION: The number of intestinal adenomas in the Min mouse model is not 
related to ENL level in plasma nor is it associated with the levels of 
intestinal lignans. A gender difference in ENL lignan metabolism was found in 
the gut but not in the plasma.

Case Report: Rapid Response to Low-Dose Thalidomide in a Case of Severe Steroid 
Recalcitrant Erythema Nodosum Leprosum.

Savitha B, Sardana K, Kumari R, Khurana A, Sinha S, Sachdeva S.

Erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL), or type 2 lepra reaction, presents with crops 
of evanescent, tender erythematous nodules accompanied by fever, arthralgia, 
malaise and organ-specific manifestations and is seen in borderline and 
lepromatous leprosy. The drugs approved for ENL include nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs, systemic steroids, thalidomide and clofazimine. The 
management of ENL is challenging because long-term steroid use leads to steroid 
dependence. The present patient had severe steroid recalcitrant ENL with 
vesicular and pustular lesions mimicking Sweet's syndrome and was treated 
effectively with a low-dose thalidomide regimen (100 mg/d) as opposed to high 
dose (400 mg/d) recommended in literature. We discuss the patho-mechanics and 
clinical utility of a low-dose thalidomide regimen as an effective treatment 
option for ENL.

In leprosy patients, acute inflammatory episodes, known as erythema nodosum 
leprosum (ENL), are responsible for high morbidity and tissue damage that occur 
during the course of Mycobacterium leprae infection. In a previous study, we 
showed evidence implicating DNA-sensing via TLR9 as an important inflammatory 
pathway in ENL. A likely important consequence of TLR9 pathway activation is the 
production of type I interferons (IFN-I) by plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), 
also implicated in the pathogenesis of several chronic inflammatory diseases. In 
this study, we investigated whether the IFN-I pathway is activated during ENL. 
Blood samples and skin lesions from multibacillary patients diagnosed with ENL 
were collected and the expression of genes of the IFN-I pathway and 
interferon-stimulated genes were compared with samples collected from 
non-reactional multibacillary (NR) patients. Whole blood RNAseq analysis 
suggested higher activation of the IFN-I pathway in ENL patients, confirmed by 
RT-qPCR. Likewise, significantly higher mRNA levels of IFN-I-related genes were 
detected in ENL skin biopsies when compared to NR patient lesions. During 
thalidomide administration, the drug of choice for ENL treatment, a decrease in 
the mRNA and protein levels of some of these genes both in the skin and blood 
was observed. Indeed, in vitro assays showed that thalidomide was able to block 
the secretion of IFN-I by peripheral blood mononuclear cells in response to M. 
leprae sonicate or CpG-A, a TLR9 ligand. Finally, the decreased frequencies of 
peripheral pDCs in ENL patients, along with the higher TLR9 expression in ENL 
pDCs and the enrichment of CD123+ cells in ENL skin lesions, suggest the 
involvement of these cells as IFN-I producers in this type of reaction. Taken 
together, our data point to the involvement of the pDC/type I IFN pathway in the 
pathogenesis of ENL, opening new avenues in identifying biomarkers for early 
diagnosis and new therapeutic targets for the better management of this 
reactional episode.

Recent data suggest that the clinical course of reactional states in leprosy is 
closely related to the cytokine profile released locally or systemically by the 
patients. In the present study, patients with erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) 
were grouped according to the intensity of their clinical symptoms. Clinical and 
immunological aspects of ENL and the impact of these parameters on bacterial 
load were assessed in conjunction with patients' in vitro immune response to 
mycobacterial antigens. In 10 out of the 17 patients tested, BI (bacterial 
index) was reduced by at least 1 log from leprosy diagnosis to the onset of 
their first reactional episode (ENL), as compared to an expected 0.3 log 
reduction in the unreactional group for the same MDT (multidrug therapy) period. 
However, no difference in the rate of BI reduction was noted at the end of MDT 
among ENL and unreactional lepromatous patients. Accordingly, although TNF-alpha 
(tumor necrosis factor) levels were enhanced in the sera of 70.6% of the ENL 
patients tested, no relationship was noted between circulating TNF-alpha levels 
and the decrease in BI detected at the onset of the reactional episode. 
Evaluation of bacterial viability of M. leprae isolated from the reactional 
lesions showed no growth in the mouse footpads. Only 20% of the patients 
demonstrated specific immune response to M. leprae during ENL. Moreover, high 
levels of soluble IL-2R (interleukin-2 receptor) were present in 78% of the 
patients. Circulating anti-neural (anti-ceramide and anti-galactocerebroside 
antibodies) and anti-mycobacterial antibodies were detected in ENL patients' 
sera as well, which were not related to the clinical course of disease. Our data 
suggest that bacterial killing is enhanced during reactions. Emergence of 
specific immune response to M. leprae and the effective role of TNF-alpha in 
mediating fragmentation of bacteria still need to be clarified.

The translocation t(11;19) is frequently found in acute leukemia in infants. 
This event truncates the proto-oncogene MLL and fuses the 5' end of MLL in frame 
with the ENL gene. ENL contributes a crucial protein-protein interaction domain 
to the resulting oncoprotein MLL-ENL. Here we show by yeast two-hybrid assays, 
GST-pull-down experiments and in a far western blot analysis that this domain is 
necessary and sufficient to recruit a novel member of the human Polycomb protein 
family (hPc3). hPc3 RNA was detected throughout the human hematopoietic system. 
Similar to other Polycomb proteins hPc3 acts as a transcriptional repressor. The 
ENL-hPc3 interaction was verified by mutual co-precipitation of the proteins 
from cell extracts. ENL and hPc3 tagged with fluorescent proteins co-localized 
in living cells in a nuclear dot pattern. An internal region of hPc3 was 
responsible for binding to ENL. Finally, hPc3 binds to the C-terminus of AF9, 
another common MLL fusion partner. The recruitment of a repressive function by 
ENL opens up a new insight into a possible mechanism of leukemogenesis by the 
fusion protein MLL-ENL.

Estrogen-induced angiogenic factors derived from stromal and cancer cells are 
differently regulated by enterolactone and genistein in human breast cancer in 
vivo.

Angiogenesis is a key in cancer progression and its regulators are released both 
by the tumor cells and the stroma. Dietary phytoestrogens, such as the lignan 
enterolactone (ENL) and the isoflavone genistein (GEN), may differently affect 
breast cancer growth. In this study, human breast cancer cells (MCF-7) were 
established in mice creating a tumor with species-specific cancer and stroma 
cells. Ovariectomized athymic mice supplemented with estradiol (E2) were fed 
basal AIN-93G diet (BD) or BD supplemented with 100 mg/kg ENL, 100 mg/kg GEN or 
their combination (ENL+GEN). We show that ENL and ENL+GEN inhibited E2-induced 
cancer growth and angiogenesis, whereas GEN alone did not. Microdialysis was 
used to sample extracellular proteins in tumors in vivo. ENL and ENL+GEN 
decreased both stroma- and cancer cell-derived VEGF, whereas cancer cell-derived 
PlGF increased. In subcutaneous Matrigel plugs in mice, ENL and ENL+GEN 
decreased E2-induced endothelial cell infiltration, whereas GEN alone did not. 
In endothelial cells, ENL inhibited E2-induced VEGFR-2 expression, whereas GEN 
did not. These results suggest that ENL has potent effects on breast cancer 
growth, even in combination with GEN, by downregulating E2-stimulated angiogenic 
factors derived both from the stroma and the cancer cells, whereas dietary GEN 
does not possess any antiestrogenic effects.

The eleven-nineteen-leukemia protein ENL connects nuclear MLL fusion partners 
with chromatin.

Mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) fusion proteins are derived from translocations at 
11q23 that occur in aggressive subtypes of leukemia. As a consequence, MLL is 
joined to different unrelated proteins to form oncogenic transcription factors. 
Here we demonstrate a direct interaction between several nuclear MLL fusion 
partners and present evidence for a role of these proteins in histone binding. 
In two-hybrid studies, ENL interacted with AF4 and AF5q31 as well as with a 
fragment of AF10. A structure-function analysis revealed that the 
AF4/AF5q31/AF10 binding domain in ENL coincided with the C-terminus that is 
essential for transformation by MLL-ENL. The ENL/AF4 association was 
corroborated by GST-pulldown experiments and by mutual coprecipitation. Both 
proteins colocalized in vivo in a nuclear speckled pattern. Moreover, AF4 and 
ENL coeluted on sizing columns together with the known ENL binding partner 
Polycomb3, suggesting the presence of a multiprotein complex. The overexpression 
of ENL alone activated a reporter construct and a mutational screen indicated 
the conserved YEATS domain as essential for this function. Overlay and 
pulldown-assays finally showed a specific and YEATS domain-dependent association 
of ENL with histones H3 and H1. In summary, our studies support a common role 
for nuclear MLL fusion partners in chromatin biology.

Higher lignan exposure has been associated with lower all-cause mortality (ACM) 
and breast cancer-specific mortality (BCSM) for postmenopausal breast cancer 
patients. However, the biological mechanisms underpinning these associations are 
still unclear. We investigated for the first time whether and to what extent the 
association between enterolactone (ENL), the major lignan metabolite, and 
postmenopausal breast cancer prognosis is mediated by inflammatory biomarkers. 
Circulating concentrations of ENL and inflammatory markers were measured in a 
population-based prospective cohort of 1,743 breast cancer patients recruited 
between 2002 and 2005 and followed-up until 2009. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% CIs 
were estimated using multivariable Cox regression. Mediation analysis was 
performed to estimate the percentage association between ENL (log2) and ACM, 
BCSM and distant disease-free survival (DDFS), which is mediated by C-reactive 
protein (CRP) (log2), as the strongest potential mediator, and also interleukin 
(IL)-10. Median serum/plasma ENL and CRP concentrations for all patients, 
including 180 deceased patients, were 23.2 and 17.5 nmol/L, and 3.2 and 6.5 
mg/l, respectively. ENL concentrations were significantly inversely associated 
with ACM, BCSM and DDFS (per doubling of ENL concentrations: HRs 0.93 [0.87, 
0.99], 0.91 [0.84, 0.99] and 0.92 [0.87, 0.99]), after adjusting for prognostic 
factors and BMI. Estimated 18, 14 and 12% of the effects of ENL on ACM, BCSM and 
DDFS, respectively, were mediated through CRP. No mediational effect of IL-10 
was found. We provide first evidence that the proinflammatory marker CRP may 
partially mediate the association of ENL with postmenopausal breast cancer 
survival, which supports hormone-independent mechanisms.

Chimeric proteins joining the histone methyltransferase MLL with various fusion 
partners trigger distinctive lymphoid and myeloid leukemias. Here, we 
immunopurified proteins associated with ENL, a protein commonly fused to MLL. 
Identification of these ENL-associated proteins (EAPs) by mass spectrometry 
revealed enzymes with a known role in transcriptional elongation (RNA polymerase 
II C-terminal domain kinase [RNAPolII CTD] positive transcription elongation 
factor b [pTEFb]), and in chromatin modification (histone-H3 methyltransferase 
DOT1L) as well as other frequent MLL partners (AF4, AF5q31, and LAF4), and 
polycomb group members (RING1, CBX8, and BCoR). The composition of EAP was 
further verified by coimmunoprecipitation, 2-hybrid analysis, pull-down, and 
colocalization experiments. Purified EAP showed a histone H3 lysine 79-specific 
methylase activity, displayed a robust RNAPolII CTD kinase function, and 
counteracted the effect of the pTEFb inhibitor 
5,6-dichloro-benzimidazole-riboside. In vivo, an ENL knock-down diminished 
genome-wide as well as gene-specific H3K79 dimethylation, reduced global run-on 
elongation, and inhibited transient transcriptional reporter activity. According 
to structure-function data, DOT1L recruitment was important for transformation 
by the MLL-ENL fusion derivative. These results suggest a function of ENL in 
histone modification and transcriptional elongation.

Chromosomal translocations that generate oncogenic fusion proteins are causative 
for most pediatric leukemias and frequently affect the MLL/KMT2A gene. In vivo 
modeling of bona fide chromosomal translocations in human hematopoietic stem and 
progenitor cells is challenging but essential to determine their actual 
leukemogenic potential. We therefore developed an advanced lentiviral 
CRISPR-Cas9 vector that efficiently transduced human CD34+ hematopoietic stem 
and progenitor cells and induced the t(11;19)/MLL-ENL translocation. Leveraging 
this system, we could demonstrate that hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells 
harboring the translocation showed only a transient clonal growth advantage in 
vitro In contrast, t(11;19)/MLL-ENL-harboring CD34+ hematopoietic stem and 
progenitor cells not only showed long-term engraftment in primary 
immunodeficient recipients, but t(11;19)/MLL-ENL also served as a first hit to 
initiate a monocytic leukemia-like disease. Interestingly, secondary recipients 
developed acute lymphoblastic leukemia with incomplete penetrance. These 
findings indicate that environmental cues not only contribute to the disease 
phenotype, but also to t(11;19)/MLL-ENL-mediated oncogenic transformation 
itself. Thus, by investigating the true chromosomal t(11;19) rearrangement in 
its natural genomic context, our study emphasizes the importance of 
environmental cues for the pathogenesis of pediatric leukemias, opening an 
avenue for novel treatment options.

We have previously shown that concanavalin A (ConA) induction of suppressor cell 
activity is impaired in patients with lepromatous leprosy (LL). In this study, 
we demonstrated that the proportion of cells bearing the Leu8 antigen 
(associated with suppressor-inducer cells) is low in LL patients and tends to 
normalize during the erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) episode. Antigen-induced 
suppressor cell function was evaluated by a two-stage assay. In the first stage, 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were cultured for 5 days either in the 
presence of gamma-irradiated Mycobacterium leprae or in tissue culture medium as 
a control. In the second stage, mitomycin C-treated suppressor or control cells 
were added to phytohemagglutinin (PHA)- or ConA-stimulated autologous PBMC. The 
results indicate that the ability of M. leprae to induce suppressor activity was 
lower in LL patients than in patients with tuberculoid (TT) and intermediate 
clinical (BB, BL, BT) forms and Mycobacterium bovis BCG-immunized normal 
controls. In ENL patients, the percent suppression was between that of TT and 
normal individuals. M. leprae-induced suppression was more effective on ConA- 
than on PHA-triggered T-cell proliferation in all groups. In contrast, normal 
PBMC cultured for 5 days in RPMI 1640 medium (N-C) and cells from patients with 
leprosy (TT-C and LL-C) had effects of their own on PHA- or ConA-induced 
proliferation. LL-C depressed the response to ConA and enhanced PHA-induced 
proliferation of autologous cells. Conversely, TT-C reduced PHA-induced 
proliferation and increased the ConA response. Suppression of proliferation 
could not be overcome with exogenous interleukin-2 and was not related to the 
induction of the Tac antigen. The abilities of LL, TT, ENL, and normal cells to 
proliferate upon PHA or ConA stimulus were similar, indicating that the defect 
in the generation of in vitro suppression by M. leprae in LL patients occurred 
during the induction period (step 1 of assay).

BACKGROUND: Leprosy, the leading infectious cause of disability worldwide, 
remains a major public health challenge in the most severely affected countries 
despite the sharp decline in new cases in recent years. The search for 
biomarkers is essential to achieve a better understanding of the molecular and 
cellular mechanisms underlying the disease.
METHODS: Pentraxin-3 (PTX3) analyses of sera from 87 leprosy patients with or 
without reactions were conducted via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In situ 
identification of PTX3 in skin lesion was confirmed by quantitative 
reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemistry, and 
immunofluorescence assays.
RESULTS: We found that PTX3 serum levels were higher in multibacillary patients 
when evaluated before the onset of acute erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) and 
persistently elevated during reaction. Thalidomide treatment reduced PTX3 in the 
serum 7 days after starting treatment. In situ analyses have also demonstrated 
enhancement of PTX3 in ENL lesions and showed that treatment with thalidomide 
reduced its expression and the prominent neutrophilic infiltrate, a hallmark of 
the disease.
CONCLUSIONS: In summary, our study provides in vivo evidence that PTX3 is 
enhanced during ENL but not in reversal reaction and provides a new molecular 
target in ENL pathogenesis.

PURPOSE: To determine the molecular characteristics, clinical features, and 
treatment outcomes of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and the 
t(11;19)(q23,p13.3) translocation.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of leukemic cell karyotypes 
obtained from patients with new diagnoses of ALL who were treated at St. Jude 
Children's Research Hospital or by the Pediatric Oncology Group was performed to 
identify cases with the t(11;19)(q23;p13.3) translocation. Molecular analyses 
were performed on these cases to determine the status of the MLL gene and the 
presence of the MLL-ENL fusion transcript.
RESULTS: Among 3,578 patients with ALL and successful cytogenetic analysis, we 
identified 35 patients with the t(11;19)(q23;p13.3) translocation: 13 infants 
and 11 older children had B-precursor leukemia, whereas 11 patients had a T-cell 
phenotype. Although all of the cases examined had MLL rearrangements and MLL-ENL 
fusion transcripts, outcome varied according to age and immunophenotype. Among 
B-precursor cases, only two of the 13 infants remain in complete remission, 
compared with six of the 11 older children. Most strikingly, no relapses have 
occurred among B-precursor patients 1 to 9 years of age or among T-cell 
patients.
CONCLUSION: Although MLL gene rearrangements are generally associated with a 
dismal outcome in ALL, two distinct subsets with MLL-ENL fusions have an 
excellent prognosis. Our results suggest that patients with this genetic 
abnormality who have T-cell ALL or are 1 to 9 years of age should not be 
considered candidates for hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation during their 
first remission.

The oncoprotein MLL-ENL disturbs hematopoietic lineage determination and 
transforms a biphenotypic lymphoid/myeloid cell.

Mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) fusion proteins are associated with a unique class 
of leukemia that is characterized by the simultaneous expression of 
lymphoid-specific as well as myeloid-specific genes. Here we report the first 
experimental model of MLL. Murine bone marrow cells were retrovirally transduced 
to express the MLL-eleven nineteen leukemia (MLL-ENL) fusion protein. When 
cultivated in flt-3 ligand, stem cell factor and interleukin-7 (IL-7) in a 
stroma-free culture system MLL-ENL-transduced as well as control cells showed a 
wave of B-lymphopoiesis. Whereas the controls exhausted their proliferative 
capacity in a CD19+/B220+ state, a continuously proliferating CD19-/B220+ cell 
population emerged in the MLL-ENL-transduced cultures. Despite the lymphoid 
surface marker, these cells were of monocytoid morphology. The immortalized 
cells contained unrearranged retrovirus, expressed MLL-ENL mRNA and were able to 
grow in syngenic recipients. From the diseased animals an MLL-ENL positive, 
B220+/CD19- cell type could be reisolated and cultivated in vitro. In analogy to 
human MLL, MLL-ENL-transformed cells not only coexpressed lymphocyte-specific 
(rag1, rag2, pax5, Tdt) and monocyte-specific genes (lysozyme, c-fms), but also 
showed rearrangements of the genomic immunoglobulin locus. This model shows that 
MLL-ENL influences events of early lineage determination and it will enable the 
investigation of the underlying molecular processes.

BACKGROUND: Leprosy reactions are immunologically mediated conditions and a 
major cause of disability before, during and after multidrug therapy (MDT). 
Little data have been published on the epidemiology of leprosy reactions in 
Bangladesh.
OBJECTIVES: To describe the pattern and prevalence of leprosy reactions in the 
postelimination stage.
METHODS: A descriptive retrospective cross-sectional study was carried out in 
Chittagong Medical College Hospital using the registered records of patients in 
the period between 2004 and 2013.
RESULTS: Of the 670 patients with leprosy, 488 (73.38%) were males and 182 
(27.37%) were females. The prevalence of reaction was in 300 (44.78%) patients 
with a male:female ratio of 3.55 : 1. The age-specific cumulative reaction cases 
at >40 years were 115 (38.33%) among all age groups. The prevalence of reaction 
was found to be in 166 (55.33%) patients for the reversal reaction, 49 (16.57%) 
for the erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) and 85 (28.33%) for the neuritis. 
Borderline tuberculoid was most common (106, 35.33%)in the reversal reaction 
group, while lepromatous leprosy was most common (37, 12.33%) in ENL group. More 
than half of the patients (169, 56.33%) had reactions at the time of 
presentations, while 85 (28.33%) and 46 (15.33%) patients developed reaction 
during and after MDT, respectively. The reversal reaction group presented with 
≥six skin lesions in 96 (57.83%) patients and ≥two nerve function impairments 
(NFIs) in 107 (64.46%) patients. The ENL was present chiefly as papulo-nodular 
lesions in 45 (91.84%) patients followed by pustule-necrotic lesions in four 
(8.16%), neuritis in 33 (67.35%), fever in 24 (48.98%), lymphadenitis in six 
(12.24%), arthritis in five (10.20%) and iritis in two (4.08%). Bacterial index 
≥3 had been demonstrated in 34 (60.71%) patients in ENL group.
CONCLUSION: The incidence of leprosy reaction seemed to be more than three times 
common in borderline tuberculoid (52.33%) group than in lepromatous leprosy 
(14%) group. Reactions with NFI and disability still occur among multibacillary 
patients during and after MDT. Early detection and management of leprosy 
reaction are very important in preventing disability and deformity, and patients 
should be educated to undergo regular follow-up examinations. Developing 
reinforced new therapies to curb leprosy reactions is crucial for improving 
leprosy healthcare services.

The chronic course of lepromatous leprosy may be interrupted by acute 
inflammatory episodes known as erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL). Despite its 
being a major cause of peripheral nerve damage in leprosy patients, the 
immunopathogenesis of ENL remains ill-defined. Recognized by distinct families 
of germline-encoded pattern recognition receptors, endogenous and 
pathogen-derived nucleic acids are highly immunostimulatory molecules that play 
a major role in the host defense against infections, autoimmunity, and 
autoinflammation. The aim of this work was to investigate whether DNA sensing 
via TLR-9 constitutes a major inflammatory pathway during ENL. Flow cytometry 
and immunohistochemistry analysis showed significantly higher TLR-9 expression 
in ENL when compared with nonreactional lepromatous patients, both locally in 
the skin lesions and in circulating mononuclear cells. The levels of endogenous 
and pathogen-derived TLR-9 ligands in the circulation of ENL patients were also 
higher. Furthermore, PBMCs isolated from the ENL patients secreted higher levels 
of TNF, IL-6, and IL-1β in response to a TLR-9 agonist than those of the 
nonreactional patients and healthy individuals. Finally, E6446, a TLR-9 
synthetic antagonist, was able to significantly inhibit the secretion of 
proinflammatory cytokines by ENL PBMCs in response to Mycobacterium leprae 
lysate. Our data strongly indicate that DNA sensing via TLR-9 constitutes a 
major innate immunity pathway involved in the pathogenesis and evolution of ENL. 
Thus, the use of TLR-9 antagonists emerges as a potential alternative to more 
effectively treat ENL aiming to prevent the development of nerve injuries and 
deformities in leprosy.

Enterolignans, products of gut bacterial metabolism of plant lignans, have been 
associated with reduced risk of chronic diseases, but their association with 
other plasma metabolites is unknown. We examined plasma metabolite profiles 
according to urinary enterolignan excretion in a cross-sectional analysis using 
data from a randomized crossover, controlled feeding study. Eighty healthy adult 
males and females completed two 28-day feeding periods differing by glycemic 
load, refined carbohydrate, and fiber content. Lignan intake was calculated from 
food records using a polyphenol database. Targeted metabolomics was performed by 
LC-MS on plasma from fasting blood samples collected at the end of each feeding 
period. Enterolactone (ENL) and enterodiol, were measured in 24 h urine samples 
collected on the penultimate day of each study period using GC-MS. Linear mixed 
models were used to test the association between enterolignan excretion and 
metabolite abundances. Pathway analyses were conducted using the Global Test. 
Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) was used to control for multiple 
testing. Of the metabolites assayed, 121 were detected in all samples. ENL 
excretion was associated positively with plasma hippuric acid and melatonin, and 
inversely with epinephrine, creatine, glycochenodeoxycholate, and glyceraldehyde 
(P < 0.05). Hippuric acid only satisfied the FDR of q < 0.1. END excretion was 
associated with myristic acid and glycine (q < 0.5). Two of 57 pathways tested 
were associated significantly with ENL, ubiquinone and terpenoid-quinone 
biosynthesis, and inositol phosphate metabolism. These results suggest a 
potential role for ENL or ENL-metabolizing gut bacteria in regulating plasma 
metabolites.

BACKGROUND: There is a paucity of data on quality of life issues in patients 
with leprosy suffering from erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL). Thus, we aim to 
study the effect of ENL on quality of life.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted in Hansen's 
Clinic, Hospital Kuala Lumpur between January 2010 and December 2013 among 
patients with multibacillary leprosy using the Dermatology Life Quality Index 
(DLQI).
RESULTS: A total of 153 patients participated with 31.4% suffering from ENL. The 
mean age at presentation was 40.5 ± 16.49 years. The mean DLQI was 7.1 ± 3.72. 
Patients with ENL were younger (mean age 36.5 vs. 42.4, P = 0.026), had higher 
mean bacteriologic index (4.3 vs. 3.8, P = 0.004), had physical deformities 
(47.9% vs. 31.4%, P = 0.049), and had higher mean DLQI score (9.1 vs. 6.2, P < 
0.001). All the DLQI domains were higher in patients suffering from ENL except 
the treatment domain. Symptoms and feeling was the domain with the largest 
effect followed by daily activities and leisure. Personal relationship had the 
lowest effect.
CONCLUSION: Quality of life impairment in patients with leprosy in Malaysia is 
moderate, with larger effect among patients with ENL. The impairment in ENL is 
comparable to itchy skin conditions such as urticarial and is worse than chronic 
skin disease such as psoriasis. Thus, it is essential that management of leprosy 
incorporate quality of life issues.

The microbial metabolism of dietary phytoestrogens varies considerably among 
individuals and influences the final exposure to bioactive compounds. In view of 
the increasing number of food supplements combining several classes of 
phytoestrogens, the microbial potential to activate various proestrogens within 
an individual was evaluated in 3 randomized dietary crossovers. Treatment 
allocation was based on participants' eligibility (>45% in vitro bioactivation 
of >or=2 separate proestrogens by fecal cultures; n = 40/100). After a run-in of 
>or=4 d, participants were given soy-, hop-, and/or flax-based food supplements 
dosed either separately (SOY: 2.83 mg daidzein aglycone equivalents/supplement, 
HOP: 1.20 mg isoxanthohumol (IX)/supplement, or FLAX: 2.08 mg 
secoisolariciresinol (SECO) aglycone equivalents/supplement; reference 
intervention) or simultaneously (MIX; test intervention) 3 times/d for 5 d, 
followed by a wash-out period (>or=7 d) and the second intervention. Before and 
after each (co)supplementation, spot urine and serum were collected. In total, 
22 equol, 19 8-prenylnaringenin (8-PN), and 21 enterolactone (ENL) producers 
completed the SOY+MIX, HOP+MIX, and FLAX+MIX trials, respectively. The microbial 
bioactivation of daidzein, IX, and SECO, generally decreased upon coincubation 
in vitro (equol: 4.4%, P = 0.164; 8-PN: 20.5%, P < 0.001; ENL: 44.3%, P < 0.001) 
and cosupplementation in vivo (equol: 28.3%, P = 0.009; 8-PN: 35.4%, P = 0.107; 
ENL: 35.9%, P = 0.003). Although the bioavailabilities of total isoflavones, 
prenylflavonoids, and lignans were not significantly affected upon 
coadministration, participants were exposed to lower phytoestrogen-derived 
17beta-estradiol equivalents. In conclusion, the bioavailability of 
phytoestrogens, especially when given in mixtures, is subject to high 
interindividual variation. These findings support the importance of personalized 
screening when assessing the efficacy of such products and mixtures.

Barrier integrity dysfunction and oxidative stress are considered hallmarks of 
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) pathogenesis. Their mitigation continues to be 
a drug discovery target in IBD. Natural products may aid treatment of chronic 
inflammatory diseases, but their use in IBD requires a better understanding of 
whether individual bioactives may positively modulate disease course. This study 
investigated the ability of flax linoorbitides (LOBs) and enterolactone (ENL), 
to mitigate inflammation-induced loss of intestinal epithelial barrier integrity 
and oxidative stress in vitro. TNF-α with INF-γ and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) 
induced an inflammatory response in HCT-8 monoculture and Caco-2/RAW-264.7 
coculture, respectively. Trans-Epithelial Electrical Resistance (TEER) and 
Lucifer Yellow rejection for barrier permeability were assessed in 
differentiated monolayers in the presence and absence of LOBs and ENL. 
Additionally, RAW 264.7 cells were used to assess protective effects upon 
induction of oxidative stress. In HCT-8 model, 200 nM of LOB-J, LOB-A, and ENL 
mitigated the inflammation-induced reduction in TEER with relative TEER values 
of 108.6%, 63.2%, and 64.2%, respectively, at 24 h relative to time zero. 
Similarly, at 24 h Caco-2/RAW-264.7 coculture TEER values ranged from ~200% - 
243.4% for LOB-A, LOB-J, LOB-ACEJ, and ENL relative to TEER values of untreated 
cells. ENL and LOBs reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) lipid peroxidation in RAW 
264.7 cells upon induction with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). ENL, but not LOBs, 
caused an increase in zona occludins 1 (ZO-1) protein expression in HCT-8 cells 
exposed to an inflammatory stimulus to levels comparable to negative control. 
Our results demonstrate after an inflammatory insult that ENL and the tested 
LOBs protect intestinal barrier integrity and reduce oxidative stress damage. In 
conclusion, use of different flax bioactives in the treatment of IBD warrants 
further investigation.

PURPOSE: To compare the success rates of external dacryocystorhinostomy 
(EXT-DCR) with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) augmented endonasal laser 
dacryocystorhinostomy (ENL-DCR) and to record the complications associated with 
5-FU augmented ENL-DCR MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective 
non-randomised study. Forty-one patients with primary acquired nasolacrimal duct 
obstruction underwent an EXT-DCR (19 patients) or an ENL-DCR (22 patients) over 
a 3-year period. A Holmium YAG laser (Ho:YAG) was used in the latter group of 
patients. Silicone tubes intubated in all patients were removed at three months. 
5-FU was applied intraoperatively at the site of the ostium in the ENL-DCR 
patients. The median follow-up was 12 months (range 3-24 months) for the ENL-DCR 
group and 22 months (range 6-28 months) for the EXT-DCR group. The patency of 
the lacrimal system and the severity of epiphora were assessed at a 
final-review.
RESULTS: The median age of the EXT-DCR group was 77 years (range 53-87) and that 
of the ENL-DCR group was 71 years (range 23 to 84). There were 12 female 
patients in the former group and 19 in the latter. The percentage of success in 
the EXT-DCR group was 94.7% (95% confidence interval (CI) = 75.4-99.1) = ), and 
63.6% in the ENL-DCR group (95% CI= 43.0-80.3). The confidence interval for the 
difference of 31.1% was 5.6-52.2. There was a statistically significant 
difference between the two groups, p=0.024 (Fisher exact test).
CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that EXT-DCR provides better results than 5-FU 
augmented ENL-DCR. However, ENL-DCR is the procedure of choice in certain 
circumstances such as in elderly, frail or medically unfit patients. Our results 
of 5-FU augmented ENL-DCR compare favourably with other published series.

Ecotropic viral integration site-1 (Evi-1) is a nuclear transcription factor 
that plays an essential role in the regulation of hematopoietic stem cells. 
Aberrant expression of Evi-1 has been reported in up to 10% of patients with 
acute myeloid leukemia and is a diagnostic marker that predicts a poor outcome. 
Although chromosomal rearrangement involving the Evi-1 gene is one of the major 
causes of Evi-1 activation, overexpression of Evi-1 is detected in a subgroup of 
acute myeloid leukemia patients without any chromosomal abnormalities, which 
indicates the presence of other mechanisms for Evi-1 activation. In this study, 
we found that Evi-1 is frequently up-regulated in bone marrow cells transformed 
by the mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) chimeric genes MLL-ENL or MLL-AF9. Analysis 
of the Evi-1 gene promoter region revealed that MLL-ENL activates transcription 
of Evi-1. MLL-ENL-mediated up-regulation of Evi-1 occurs exclusively in the 
undifferentiated hematopoietic population, in which Evi-1 particularly 
contributes to the propagation of MLL-ENL-immortalized cells. Furthermore, 
gene-expression analysis of human acute myeloid leukemia cases demonstrated the 
stem cell-like gene-expression signature of MLL-rearranged leukemia with high 
levels of Evi-1. Our findings indicate that Evi-1 is one of the targets of MLL 
oncoproteins and is selectively activated in hematopoietic stem cell-derived MLL 
leukemic cells.

Erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) is a well-known immunological serious 
complication affecting lepromatous multibacillary leprosy patients. For a long 
time, ENL has been regarded as an immune complex-mediated disease or Arthus 
phenomenon. Recently, it has been reported that ENL was associated with high 
serum tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFa) levels, suggesting that this cytokine 
could also play a central role in the manifestations of ENL. Thalidomide (TH) 
and systemic steroids (S), both TNFa production inhibitors, are the two current 
effective drugs for the management of ENL. However, TH is rarely available in 
leprosy endemic countries, and its teratogenicity and neurotoxicity strongly 
limit its use. Moreover, the morbidity of S and the frequent steroid-dependence 
of ENL also create real therapeutic problems. Recently, the efficacy of 
pentoxifylline (PTX), which also inhibits in vitro and in vivo production of 
TNFa, has been suggested for ENL treatment. We report our experience on its use 
for the treatment of 15 leprosy patients suffering from a first ENL. attack. (11 
cases), a chronic steroid-dependent ENL (3 cases) or chronic steroid- and 
thalidomide-dependent ENL (1 case). PTX has been given at 800 mg t.i.d, (2 
cases) or 400 mg t.i.d. (13 cases) doses. The patients received PTX at the 
initiating dosage until complete clinical cure. At the end of ENL attacks, PTX 
was either abruptly stopped or tapered down over the next 4 months. In ten of 11 
patients who developed ENL for the first time, the systemic symptoms and 
neuritic pains disappeared within one week; at three weeks, half of the patients 
were cured and the other half had striking clinical improvement; complete cure 
was obtained within 7 to 35 days (mean: 27 days). A relapse occurred within 2-3 
months in the 5 patients, in which PTX was abruptly stopped. In contrast, no 
relapse occurred in the patients who benefited from decreasing doses of PTX. 
Recurrent ENL episodes also responded well to PTX. The 3 patients who had 
chronic steroid-dependent ENL failed to show any improvement after 3 to 6 weeks 
of PTX. In contrast, steroid therapy could be stopped in the steroid- and 
thalidomide-dependent patient. Our results confirm the action of PTX if it is 
slowly tapered down (4 months seem sufficient) and not abruptly to avoid 
relapses. As it is safe use, PTX could constitute the first line of ENL attack 
treatment.

Flaxseeds have been known for their anti-cancerous effects due to the high 
abundance of lignans released upon ingestion. The most abundant lignan, 
secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG), is ingested during the dietary intake of 
flax, and is then metabolized in the gut into two mammalian lignan derivatives, 
Enterodiol (END) and Enterolactone (ENL). These lignans were previously reported 
to possess anti-tumor effects against breast, colon, and lung cancer. This study 
aims to investigate the potential anti-cancerous effect of the flaxseed lignans 
SDG, END and ENL on acute myeloid leukemia cells (AML) in vitro and to decipher 
the underlying molecular mechanism. AML cell lines, (KG-1 and Monomac-1) and a 
normal lymphoblastic cell line were cultured and treated with the purified 
lignans. ENL was found to be the most promising lignan, as it exhibits a 
significant selective dose- and time-dependent cytotoxic effect in both AML cell 
lines, contrary to normal cells. The cytotoxic effects observed were attributed 
to apoptosis induction, as revealed by an increase in Annexin V staining of AML 
cells with increasing ENL concentrations. The increase in the percentage of 
cells in the pre-G phase, in addition to cell death ELISA analysis, validated 
cellular and DNA fragmentation respectively. Analysis of protein expression 
using western blots confirmed the activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway 
upon ENL treatment. This was also accompanied by an increase in ROS production 
intracellularly. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that ENL has promising 
anti-cancer effects in AML cell lines in vitro, by promoting DNA fragmentation 
and the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, highlighting the protective health benefits 
of flax seeds in leukemia.

ENL, the gene fused with HRX in t(11;19) leukemias, encodes a nuclear protein 
with transcriptional activation potential in lymphoid and myeloid cells.

Chromosome band 11q23 is the site of recurring translocations with a variety of 
partner chromosomes in myeloid and lymphoid acute leukemias, infant leukemias, 
and treatment-induced secondary acute myelogenous leukemia. The translocation 
breakpoints cluster in a restricted region of the HRX gene resulting in fusion 
genes that encode an N-terminal portion of Hrx fused to various partner 
proteins. We have characterized the transcriptional transactivation properties 
of Enl, a protein that is fused to Hrx in t(11;19) leukemias. Enl is a nuclear 
protein that is capable of activating transcription from synthetic reporter 
genes in both lymphoid and myeloid cells, as well as in yeast. Deletion 
mutagenesis demonstrated that the minimal portion of Enl required for activation 
of transcription was localized to its C-terminal 90 amino acids. This region is 
highly conserved between Enl and the t(9;11) fusion partner Af-9 and is retained 
in all Hrx-Enl and Hrx-Af9 fusion proteins. Thus, the leukemogenic contribution 
and transcriptional activation potential of Enl colocalize to its highly 
conserved carboxy terminus, suggesting that Hrx-Enl chimeric proteins mediate 
alterations in the transcription program of t(11;19)-bearing cells.

Erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) is an inflammatory complication caused by a 
dysregulated immune response to Mycobacterium leprae. Some Toll-like receptors 
(TLRs) have been identified as capable of recognizing antigens from M. leprae, 
triggering a wide antimicrobial and inflammatory response. Genetic polymorphisms 
in these receptors could influence in the appearance of ENL as well as in its 
treatment. Thus, the objective of this work was to evaluate the association of 
genetic variants of TLRs genes with the response to treatment of ENL with 
thalidomide and prednisone. A total of 162 ENL patients were recruited from 
different regions of Brazil and clinical information was collected from their 
medical records. Genomic DNA was isolated from blood and saliva samples and 
genetic variants in TLR1 (rs4833095), TLR2 (rs3804099), TLR4 (rs1927914), and 
TLR6 (rs5743810) genes were genotyped by TaqMan real-time PCR system. In order 
to evaluate the variants' association with the dose of the medications used 
during the treatment, we applied the Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) 
analysis. In the present sample, 123 (75.9%) patients were men and 86 (53.1%) 
were in treatment for leprosy during the ENL episode. We found an association 
between polymorphisms in TLR1/rs4833095, TLR2/rs3804099, TLR4/rs1927914, and 
TLR6/rs5783810 with the dose variation of thalidomide in a time-dependent 
manner, i.e., the association with the genetic variant and the dose of the drug 
was different depending on the moment of the treatment evaluated. In addition, 
we identified that the association of polymorphisms in TLR1/rs4833095, 
TLR2/rs3804099, and TLR6/rs5783810 with the dose variation of prednisone also 
were time-dependent. Despite these associations, in all the interactions found, 
the influence of genetic variants on dose variation was not clinically relevant 
for therapeutic changes. The results obtained in this study show that TLRs 
polymorphism might play a role in the response to ENL treatment, however, in 
this context, they could not be considered as useful biomarkers in the clinical 
setting due small differences in medication doses. A larger sample size with 
patients with a more genetic profile is fundamental in order to estimate the 
association of genetic variants with the treatment of ENL and their clinical 
significance.

It is well known that reactions are commonplace occurrences during the course of 
leprosy disease. Stigmatization may even be attributable to reactions which are 
also responsible for the worsening of neural lesions. A cohort of 162 
newly-diagnosed baciloscopically positive patients from the Leprosy Care 
Outpatient Clinic of the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (FIOCRUZ) was selected for this 
study. While 46% of the multibacillary (MB) patients submitted to the 24 
fixed-dose multidrug therapy (MDT) regimen suffered reactions during treatment, 
it was found that all MBs were susceptible and that constant attention and care 
were required at all times. Fourteen per cent were classified as BB, 52% as BL, 
and 33% as LL. None of the variables under study, such as, sex, age, clinical 
form, length of illness, length of dermatological lesions, baciloscopic index 
(BI), or degree of disability proved to be associate with reaction among the 
patients studied. Reversal Reaction (RR) occurred in 45%, and Erythema Nodosum 
Leprosum (ENL) occurred in 55%. Among BB patients who developed reactions (15 
patients), 93% presented RR; while among the LL patients who developed reactions 
(34 patients), 91% presented ENL. Likewise, ENL was very frequent among those 
with disseminate lesions, while RR was most often observed in patients with 
segmentary lesions. RR was also most likely to occur during the initial months 
of treatment. It was demonstrated that the recurrence rate of ENL was 
significantly higher than that of RR. Neither grade of disability nor BI was 
shown to be associated with RR and ENL reaction. However, the RR rate was 
significantly higher among patients showing BI < 3, while ENL predominated among 
those patients with BI > 3.

Retroviral expression of leukemogenic oncogenes in the murine hematopoietic 
system is essential but not sufficient to induce acute leukemia. Proviral 
integration-mediated elevated expression of the meningioma 1 (MN1) oncogene 
suggested MN1 acting as cooperating event in mixed-lineage leukemia 1 (MLL) and 
eleven nineteen leukemia (ENL)-induced murine leukemia. Indeed, co-expression of 
MN1 with MLL-ENL enhanced transformation in vivo, and resulted in a 
significantly reduced latency for induction of an aggressive acute leukemia when 
compared with MN1 or MLL-ENL alone. In addition, co-expression of MN1 increased 
the granulocyte macrophage progenitor cell population with leukemia-initiating 
properties as shown in secondary transplantation experiments. Gene expression 
profiling experiments identified putative downstream MN1 targets, of which 
FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) and CD34 were upregulated in both 
MN1-overexpressing murine leukemias and in pediatric acute leukemias with high 
MN1 levels. Interestingly, small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated MN1 knockdown 
resulted in cell cycle arrest and impaired clonogenic growth of human leukemia 
cell lines with high MN1 levels. Our work shows for the first time that high MN1 
levels are important for the growth of leukemic cells, and that increased MN1 
expression can synergize with MLL-ENL and probably other transforming fusion 
genes in leukemia induction through a distinct gene expression program that is 
able to expand the leukemia-initiating cell population.

The mammalian lignan enterolactone (ENL), which is produced from dietary 
plant-lignan precursors by the intestinal microflora, may protect against breast 
cancer and other hormone-dependent cancers. This cross-sectional study examined 
which variables related to diet and lifestyle were associated with high plasma 
concentrations of ENL in Danish postmenopausal women. Plasma ENL was measured by 
time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay in 857 Danish women aged 50-64 y who 
participated in a prospective cohort study. Diet was assessed using a 
semiquantitative FFQ, and background information on lifestyle was collected 
using a self-administered questionnaire. Multiple analyses of covariance were 
completed in two steps. The median plasma ENL concentration was 27 nmol/L (range 
0-455 nmol/L). In covariance analyses, positive associations were found between 
consumption of cereals, vegetables, and beverages and plasma ENL concentration. 
When analyzing subgroups of these food groups, the associations were confined to 
whole-grain products, cabbage, leafy vegetables, and coffee. For fat and the 
nondietary variables, negative associations between BMI, smoking, and frequency 
of bowel movements and plasma ENL concentration were observed. These data show 
that foods high in ENL precursors are associated with high concentrations of 
ENL. Furthermore, smoking, frequent bowel movements, and consumption of fat 
seems to have a negative affect on the ENL concentration. In conclusion, whole 
grains and vegetables are the most important dietary providers of plant lignans 
for the concentration of ENL in Danish postmenopausal women, and if ENL is found 
to protect against cancer or heart disease, the intake of whole grains and 
vegetables should be increased.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the in vitro effect of the combination of lignan 
enterolactone (ENL) or lignan enterodiol (END) with melatonin on steroid hormone 
secretion and cellular aromatase content in human adrenal carcinoma cells.
SAMPLE: Human adrenocortical carcinoma cells.
PROCEDURES: Melatonin plus ENL or END was added to cell culture medium along 
with cAMP (100μM); control cells received cAMP alone. Medium and cell lysates 
were collected after 24 and 48 hours of cultivation. Samples of medium were 
analyzed for progesterone, 17-hydroxyprogesterone, androstenedione, aldosterone, 
estradiol, and cortisol concentration by use of radioimmunoassays. Cell lysates 
were used for western blot analysis of aromatase content.
RESULTS: The addition of ENL or END with melatonin to cAMP-stimulated cells 
(treated cells) resulted in significant decreases in estradiol, androstenedione, 
and cortisol concentrations at 24 and 48 hours, compared with concentrations in 
cells stimulated with cAMP alone (cAMP control cells). The addition of these 
compounds to cAMP-stimulated cells also resulted in higher progesterone and 
17-hydroxyprogesterone concentrations than in cAMP control cells; aldosterone 
concentration was not affected by treatments. Compared with the content in cAMP 
control cells, aromatase content in treated cells was significantly lower.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The combination of lignan and melatonin 
affected steroid hormone secretion by acting directly on adrenal tumor cells. 
Results supported the concept that this combination may yield similar effects on 
steroid hormone secretion by the adrenal glands in dogs with typical and 
atypical hyperadrenocorticism.

The quantity of mammalian lignans enterolactone (ENL) and enterodiol (END) and 
of plant lignans secoisolariciresinol (SECO) and 7-hydroxymatairesinol (HMR) 
excreted in a 24-h rat urine sample was measured after a single p.o. dose of an 
equivalent quantity of secoisolariciresinol diglycoside (SDG), 
secoisolariciresinol (SECO), matairesinol (MR), 7-hydroxymatairesinol (HMR) and 
ENL. Plant lignans (SECO and HMR) were partially absorbed as such. The aglycone 
form of SECO was more efficiently converted into mammalian lignans END and ENL 
than the glycosylated form, SDG. Of plant lignans, MR produced the highest 
quantities of ENL: the quantity was over twofold compared with HMR or SDG. The 
majority of the animals, which had been given SECO, excreted higher quantities 
of END than ENL into urine, but ENL was the main lignan metabolite after SDG. 
The highest quantities of ENL in urine were measured after the administration of 
ENL as such. The (-)SECO isolated from Araucaria angustifolia was converted into 
(-)ENL only. The administration of (-)SDG, which was shown to produce (+)SECO, 
resulted in excretion of (+)ENL only and (-)HMR was converted into (-)ENL only. 
This confirmed that the absolute configurations at C8 and C8' are not changed 
during the microbial metabolism. Whether the biological effects are 
enantiomer-specific, remains to be resolved.

Immunoprofile of reactions in leprosy.

Sehgal VN, Gautam RK, Sharma VK.

The immunologic profile during erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) revealed 
increased percentage and absolute count of B-lymphocytes, in addition to 
considerably lowered levels of complement component C3. Serum 
immunoglobulins--IgG, IgA, and IgM--were significantly raised after subsidence 
of ENL, whereas upgrading reaction showed an increase of absolute count of total 
T lymphocytes and percentage and count of B-lymphocytes. In addition, a raised 
serum IgM level was noted after regression of ENL. Downgrading reaction 
demonstrated a decreased percentage of early T-lymphocytes and raised the 
absolute count of B-lymphocytes. Serum IgA levels were found to be increased 
after amelioration of ENL.

BACKGROUND: The expression of B7 as a costimulatory molecule on the surface of 
antigen-presenting cells such as macrophages and on dendritic cells 
characterizes the efficiency of the cell-mediated immune response.
AIMS: Our purpose was to evaluate B7-1 expression in peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) immediately after cell isolation ('spontaneous' B7 
expression), and in inflammatory cells from cutaneous lesions of patients with 
multibacillary leprosy (MB-L) without and during the reactional states of 
erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) or reversal reaction (RR).
METHODS: Peripheral blood samples and skin biopsies of eight patients without 
(MB-L) and with reactional episodes (ENL and RR) were studied using antibodies 
against B7-1, CD1b, DR and CD14 in flow-cytometry and immunohistochemistry 
experiments.
RESULTS: The flow-cytometry studies (mean +/- SD% of fluorescent cells) revealed 
significant B7-1 expression on PBMCs isolated from patients with ENL (8.0 +/- 
0.6%) and RR (15.0 +/- 1.4%) compared with that observed for patients with MB-L 
(0.4 +/- 0.2%). Similar results were observed for cutaneous lesions of these 
patients by immunohistochemical assays. One patient studied before and during 
ENL revealed weak B7 expression before the reactional episode (0.3% of cells) 
compared with the marked level of B7-expressing cells detected during ENL (8.5% 
fluorescent cells). Interestingly, an even higher B7 expression (15% of cells) 
was observed in patients with RR.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results strongly suggest that B7 expression precedes reactional 
episodes in MB-L, which could be related to the acquisition of effective 
immunity to Mycobacterium leprae during reactional episodes in leprosy. We 
propose B7 expression as a marker of CMI response in reactional episodes in 
leprosy.

BACKGROUND: Molecular and cellular events that resulted in leukemia development 
are well characterized but initial engraftment and proliferation of leukemic 
cells in bone marrow and early modifications of the bone marrow microenvironment 
induced by engrafted leukemic cells remain to be clarified.
DESIGN AND METHODS: After retro-orbital injection of 1,000 leukemic cells 
expressing Mixed Lineage Leukemia-Eleven Nineteen Leukemia fusion protein in 
non-conditioned syngenic mice, kinetics of leukemic burden and alterations of 
femoral hematopoietic populations were followed using an in vivo confocal 
imaging system and flow cytometry.
RESULTS: Three days after injection, 5% of leukemic cells were found in femurs. 
Little proliferation of engrafted leukemic cells could then be detected for more 
than two weeks while the number of femoral leukemic cells remained stable. 
Twenty days after injection, leukemic cells preferentially proliferated in 
femoral diaphysis where they formed clusters on the surface of blood vessels and 
bone. B220(+) lymphoid cells were found near these leukemic cell clusters and 
this association is correlated with a decreased number of femoral B220(+)IgM(+) 
cells. Increasing the number of injected leukemic cells or conditioning 
recipient mice with γ-irradiation resulted in leukemic cell development in 
diaphysis and knee. Competition experiments indicate that proliferation but not 
engraftment is a rate-limiting factor of leukemic cells spreading in diaphysis. 
Finally, 30 days after injection leukemia developed.
CONCLUSIONS: After retro-orbital injection of 1,000 leukemic cells expressing 
Mixed Lineage Leukemia-Eleven Nineteen Leukemia into syngenic mice, leukemic 
cell burden preferentially initiates in femoral diaphysis and is preceded by 
changes of femoral B-lymphoid populations.

OBJECTIVE: This study assessed the accuracy and reliability of three continuous 
glucose monitoring (CGM) systems.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied the Animas® (West Chester, PA) Vibe™ 
with Dexcom® (San Diego, CA) G4™ version A sensor (G4A), the Abbott Diabetes 
Care (Alameda, CA) Freestyle® Navigator I (NAV), and the Medtronic (Northridge, 
CA) Paradigm® with Enlite™ sensor (ENL) in 20 patients with type 1 diabetes 
mellitus. All systems were investigated both in a clinical research center (CRC) 
and at home. In the CRC, patients received a meal with a delayed and increased 
insulin dose to induce a postprandial glucose peak and nadir. Hereafter, 
randomization determined which two of the three systems would be worn at home 
until the end of functioning, attempting use beyond manufacturer-specified 
lifetime. Patients performed at least five reference finger sticks per day. An 
analysis of variance was performed on all data points ≥15 min apart.
RESULTS: Overall average mean absolute relative difference (MARD) (SD) measured 
at the CRC was 16.5% (14.3%) for NAV and 16.4% (15.6%) for ENL, outperforming 
G4A at 20.5% (18.2%) (P<0.001). Overall MARD when assessed at home was 14.5% 
(16.7%) for NAV and 16.5 (18.8%) for G4A, outperforming ENL at 18.9% (23.6%) 
(P=0.006). Median time until end of functioning was similar: 10.0 (1.0) days for 
G4A, 8.0 (3.5) days for NAV, and 8.0 (1.5) days for ENL (P=0.119).
CONCLUSIONS: In the CRC, G4A was less accurate than NAV and ENL sensors, which 
seemed comparable. However, at home, ENL was less accurate than NAV and G4A. 
Moreover, CGM systems often show sufficient accuracy to be used beyond 
manufacturer-specified lifetime.

A considerable number of studies have postulated significant associations 
between susceptibility to the different clinical manifestations of leprosy and 
the MHC. In this investigation, the association between the MHC class III 
complement proteins C2, BF, C4A and C4B and leprosy in a patient population of 
Southern Brazil was studied. A total of 109 non-related leprosy patients was 
investigated; 73 presented with lepromatous leprosy (LL), 46 of them had the 
immunopathological reaction of erythema nodosum (ENL), the remaining 36 were 
tuberculoid, borderline and indeterminate leprosy (TIBL) patients. The control 
group included 172 healthy individuals matched with the patients according to 
their ethnic and geographical origin. C2, BF, C4A and C4B allotypes were 
determined by standard technologies including Western blots for C2 and C4 
variant alleles with monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies. Non-expressed 
('silent') C4 alleles in hemizygously deficient individuals were estimated 
semiquantitatively on the basis of the C4A and C4B isotype ratio and by the MASC 
('minimal chi-square') method. The results showed a significantly elevated 
presence of the non-expressed C4B allele (C4B*Q0) in the LL and ENL patient 
groups in comparison with the controls. The most significant difference was 
observed in the ENL group when compared with the controls. In addition, all 
patients who were homozygously C4B-deficient had ENL, and most of them had the 
BF*F1 allele. The comparison between LL patients with and without ENL also 
showed a statistically significant difference in the presence of C4B*Q0, 
indicating that C4B deficiency itself is associated with ENL. The relative risk 
of LL patients with the C4B*Q0 allele suffering from ENL was 5.3 compared with 
LL patients without C4B*Q0. Since immune complexes (IC) are considered to be the 
pathogenic cause of ENL, our findings indicate that C4B deficiency may play an 
important role in the abnormal immune response against Mycobacterium leprae and 
in the lack of IC clearance, leading to ENL reactions. Individuals with this 
allele seem to be at a higher risk of developing pathological immune reactivity 
in lepromatous leprosy.

Chromosomal rearrangements of the human MLL gene are associated with high-risk 
pediatric, adult and therapy-associated acute leukemias. These patients need to 
be identified, treated appropriately and minimal residual disease was monitored 
by quantitative PCR techniques. Genomic DNA was isolated from individual acute 
leukemia patients to identify and characterize chromosomal rearrangements 
involving the human MLL gene. A total of 760 MLL-rearranged biopsy samples 
obtained from 384 pediatric and 376 adult leukemia patients were characterized 
at the molecular level. The distribution of MLL breakpoints for clinical 
subtypes (acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, pediatric and 
adult) and fused translocation partner genes (TPGs) will be presented, including 
novel MLL fusion genes. Combined data of our study and recently published data 
revealed 104 different MLL rearrangements of which 64 TPGs are now characterized 
on the molecular level. Nine TPGs seem to be predominantly involved in genetic 
recombinations of MLL: AFF1/AF4, MLLT3/AF9, MLLT1/ENL, MLLT10/AF10, MLLT4/AF6, 
ELL, EPS15/AF1P, MLLT6/AF17 and SEPT6, respectively. Moreover, we describe for 
the first time the genetic network of reciprocal MLL gene fusions deriving from 
complex rearrangements.

Chromosomal rearrangements involving the mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene at 
11q23 are frequent in adult and childhood acute leukemia and have been 
associated with an unfavorable prognosis. Recent evidence suggests that MLL gene 
partners may influence prognosis. Five translocations account for approximately 
80% of MLL rearrangements: t(4;11)(q21;q23), AFF1/MLL; t(6;11)(q27;q23), 
MLLT4/MLL; t(9;11)(p22;q23), MLLT3/MLL; t(11;19)(q23;p13.1), MLL/ELL; and 
t(11;19)(q23;p13.3), MLL/MLLT1. We have designed dual-color, double-fusion 
fluorescence in situ hybridization (D-FISH) probe sets to identify these 
translocations. A blinded study was performed for each probe set using 25 normal 
bone marrow samples, 25 t(4;11), 20 t(6;11), 20 t(9;11), 18 t(11;19p13.1), and 
20 t(11;19p13.3) leukemia specimens as defined by chromosome analysis. The 
findings demonstrated abnormal D-FISH results for 24 of 25 AFF1/MLL, 19 of 20 
MLLT4/MLL, all 20 MLLT3/MLL, all 18 MLL/ELL, and all 20 MLL/MLLT1 samples, 
confirming the efficacy of these D-FISH assays in detecting these common 
MLL/partner translocations. Our D-FISH assays were more accurate than chromosome 
analysis at distinguishing disruption of 19p13.1/ELL from that of 19p13.3/MLLT1. 
We also demonstrated a statistically significant increase in complex/unbalanced 
MLL/partner translocations occurring in pediatric patients versus adult patients 
(P = 0.02). A normal cutoff of 0.6% was established, suggesting an application 
for these assays in minimal residual disease detection and disease monitoring.

Beneficial Effect of Minocycline as Additional Treatment to Prednisone for 
Pustular Erythema Nodosum Leprosum.

INTRODUCTION: Pustular erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) is an atypical 
manifestation associated with chronic ENL. The use of corticosteroid alone might 
not be sufficient for this condition, and addition of another anti-inflammatory 
drug is often necessary. Minocycline is a tetracycline antibiotic with 
anti-neutrophilic properties, which may accelerate the treatment of pustular 
ENL. This case report aimed to elaborate on the beneficial effect of minocycline 
for pustular ENL.
CASE: We report a case of pustular ENL in a 23-year-old male who had been 
released from treatment (RFT) of lepromatous leprosy (LL). The patient had been 
on prednisone for six months as treatment for ENL. The condition recurred when 
prednisone was tapered to 10 mg daily. Eventually, pustules developed on the 
erythematous nodules, and the lesions did not improve despite seven weeks of 
treatment with 40-60 mg prednisone. Later, 100 mg minocycline once daily was 
given in addition to 60 mg prednisone once daily and improvement was rapidly 
observed on the ninth day after minocycline administration. This condition was 
sustained for four weeks with prednisone tapering, and no side effects were 
reported during the treatment.
DISCUSSION: Minocycline is an antibiotic with anti-inflammatory properties. Only 
a few studies have been conducted regarding the use of minocycline in chronic 
ENL, but there was no reported case of minocycline use for pustular ENL in RFT 
patient. The addition of minocycline to prednisone may accelerate the 
improvement of pustular ENL. We observed an improvement after the ninth day of 
minocycline administration compared to seven weeks of prednisone monotherapy. No 
new ENL lesions occurred during four weeks of minocycline administration 
therapy.
CONCLUSION: Pustular ENL is an atypical manifestation of chronic ENL, and the 
addition of minocycline to prednisone may accelerate its therapeutic effect on 
the patient.

The mammalian lignans enterolactone (ENL) and enterodiol, commonly found in 
human plasma and urine, are phytoestrogens that may contribute to the prevention 
of breast cancer and coronary heart disease. They are formed by the conversion 
of dietary precursors such as secoisolariciresinol and matairesinol lignans by 
the colonic microflora. The identification of lignins, cell-wall polymers 
structurally related to lignans, as precursors of mammalian lignans is reported 
here for the first time. In study 1, rats were fed rye or wheat bran (15% diet) 
for 5 d. Untreated brans and brans extracted with solvents to remove lignans 
were compared. ENL was estimated in urine samples collected for 24 h by 
time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay. ENL urinary excretion was reduced from 18.6 to 
5.3 nmol/d (n=8; P<0.001) when lignans were removed from rye bran and from 30.5 
to 6.2 nmol/d (P<0.001) when they were removed from wheat bran. These results 
suggest that lignins, embedded in the cell wall and retained in the bran during 
solvent extraction, account for 26-32% of the ENL formed from cereal brans. In 
study 2, rats were fed a deuterated synthetic lignin (0.2% diet) together with 
wheat bran (15%) for 3 d. The detection of deuterated ENL by LC-tandem MS in 
urine (20 nmol/d) clearly confirms the conversion of lignin into mammalian 
lignans. More research is warranted to determine the bioavailability of lignins 
in the human diet.

Recently, the MLL gene at 11q23 was found to be involved in a subset of 
leukemias with an 11q23 abnormality. In the present study, we isolated chimeric 
cDNAs between the MLL and a gene designated MLLT3 at 9p22 from a cDNA library of 
an IMS-M1 cell line with a t(9;11)(p22;q23) translocation, a representative 
karyotypic abnormality seen in acute monocytic leukemia. We also isolated a 
normal MLLT3 cDNA and found an open reading frame encoding at least 318 amino 
acids with high serine/proline content (24.8%). The chimeric mRNAs were 
demonstrated to be fused to MLL in frame, as found in t(11;19) and t(4;11) 
leukemias. The predicted MLLT3 protein demonstrated a significant homology to 
that of the MLLT1 gene at 19p13 involved in t(11;19) leukemia. The highest 
homology, up to 74.1%, was found in 86 amino acids of the C-terminus, suggesting 
that this region is of particular importance for leukemogenesis in t(9;11) 
leukemia. Northern blot analysis with the MLLT3 cDNA probe against normal 
tissues revealed multiple transcripts in lymphoid organs. A survey of 
hematopoietic cell lines demonstrated relatively stronger signals in cells 
belonging to megakaryocytic and erythroid lineages. As previously found in 
t(11;19) leukemia, heterogeneous MLL-MLLT3 chimeric mRNAs could be detected by 
the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in t(9;11) leukemia 
samples.

Some unusual type 2 reactions in leprosy.

Medical College, New Delhi, India. weramesh@hotmail.com

BACKGROUND: Type 2 reactions with lepromatous leprosy (LL) not occurring during 
multi-drug therapy (MDT) have been reported.
METHODS: Three patients have been described, each representing a prototype, the 
first presenting as bullous erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL), second with ENL 
erupting after treatment for co-existing pulmonary tuberculosis and resembling 
immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome, and a third patient with recurrent 
Sweets-syndrome like presentation who had taken incomplete MDT in the past for 
leprosy. In all, the diagnosis was established by demonstration of acid-fast 
bacilli (AFB) on slit-skin smears (SSS) and histopathology.
RESULTS & CONCLUSION: The fact that reactions can occur in patients with 
clinically inapparent LL, who are more likely to present in general hospitals, 
has been reemphasized to enhance awareness among physicians. First presentation 
of leprosy as ENL is probably precipitated by common antibiotics taken for other 
illnesses. Since reactional episodes can occur before, during and after MDT for 
leprosy and the clinical picture is not specific to any of them, it is important 
to ascertain the status of anti-leprosy therapy during these episodes and treat 
them accordingly.

for prediction of conversion of flaxseed lignans to enterolactone with reference 
to an in vivo rat model.

BACKGROUND: In vitro fermentation models have been used widely for studies of 
shortchain fatty acid (SCFA) formation from carbohydrates, whereas the 
suitability of these methods for enterolactone (ENL) formation has received less 
attention.
AIM: The aim was to study the suitability of an in vitro fermentation model for 
prediction of bioconversion of lignans to ENL, to compare the approach with that 
of an in vivo rat model and to study the SCFA formation in both models.
METHODS: Predigested samples of rye bran (R), flaxseed meal (F) alone, or in 
combination with rye bran (R&F) and a faecal control were incubated in an in 
vitro fermentation model using human faecal microbiota. In the in vivo 
experiment rats consumed a non-fibre control diet (C) or diets supplemented 
either with rye bran (R), flaxseed meal (F) alone, or with their combination 
(R&F) for four weeks. Enterodiol (END), ENL and SCFA concentrations were 
measured from in vitro faecal fermentation samples and from the intestinal 
contents of rats. Plasma ENL concentrations from rats were also measured.
RESULTS: The highest ENL production was found in vitro with the F supplement 
(areas under curve: 740 +/- 4, 7,500 +/- 400, 2,600 +/- 500 and 1,520 +/- 70 
nmol x h for the R, F, R&F supplements and faecal control, respectively). In 
vivo, the concentration of ENL in caecal digesta from flaxseed meal was 
significantly (P < 0.05) enhanced by the presence of rye bran (medians 261, 407 
and 24 nmol/g in the F, R&F and C groups, respectively). No correlation was 
found between the models regarding ENL production, possibly due to different 
responses to the presence of rye bran matrix, differences in microbiota or 
application of a batch in the in vitro fermentation model. Rye bran 
supplementation enhanced butyrate production both in vitro and in vivo.
CONCLUSION: In vitro fermentation and the in vivo rat models responded 
differently to the presence of rye bran and no correlation with regard to the 
ENL formation from flaxseed lignans was observed.

Erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) is an acute immune complex-mediated condition of 
the dermis, subcutaneous tissue, and other tissues seen in patients with 
multibacillary (MB) leprosy, causing severe impairment to patients' quality of 
life. To date, there is no standard diagnostic criteria for ENL. We aimed to 
study the diagnostic value and accuracy of Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte ratio (NLR), 
Lymphocyte-to-Monocyte ratio (LMR), and Platelet-to-Lymphocyte ratio (PLR) in 
diagnosing ENL. This is an analytic retrospective study with a cross-sectional 
design that describes the distribution and clinical characteristics of all newly 
diagnosed MB patients of Dr. Soetomo General Hospital Surabaya in the years 
2018-2020. NLR, LMR, and PLR were calculated for all patients, and a receiver 
operating characteristic curve (ROC) was generated to identify the cut-off 
points. Among a total of 182 patients with MB leprosy, 22 cases (12.09%) were 
reported with ENL. WBC, neutrophils, monocytes, and thrombocytes showed a 
positive correlation with the incidence of ENL, but not lymphocytes. The NLR 
cut-off point for the diagnosis of ENL was 4.99 (sensitivity 86.4%, specificity 
82.5%, accuracy 82.97), while that of PLR was 237.46 (sensitivity 63.6%, 
specificity 73.1%, accuracy 71.98%). LMR had poor sensitivity and specificity 
levels of 50% and 28.7%, with cut-off point of 2.28 and accuracy of 31.32%. 
These results suggest that NLR and PLR could be potential biomarkers for the 
diagnosis of ENL.

We analyzed 12 MLL/ENL positive ALL patients consecutively diagnosed between 
1999 and 2009. The MLL/ENL fusion was identified in 4/150 (2.6%), 8/993 (0.8%), 
and 0/70 of pediatric, adult, and elderly patients, respectively. Eight patients 
had a WBC count >50 × 10(9) /L. Ten cases had an evaluable immunophenotyping. A 
B or T precursor ALL occurred in 7 and 3 patients, respectively. Eleven/12 
patients (92%) achieved CR. At 48 months, overall survival and event-free 
survival rates were 73.3% and 67%, respectively. At CR, a parallel RT-PCR 
evaluation of the MLL/ENL expression was available in 5 cases. Of these latter, 
2 tested MLL/ENL-negative and 3 positive. The minimal residual disease molecular 
monitoring showed that MLL/ENL status did not correlate with outcome. In fact, 
all the 2 PCR-negative and 1 of the 3 PCR-positive cases relapsed. Further, a 
MLL/ENL expression, not preceding a relapse, was detected several times during 
the follow-up of five long-survivors. In conclusion, also in adults, the MLL/ENL 
fusion identifies a rare leukemic entity with a favorable prognosis. The 
observed inconsistency between the clinical cure and the presence of detectable 
MLL/ENL transcript suggests the existence of a MLL/ENL-expressing "preleukemia" 
stem cells, similar to what demonstrated for the AML1/ETO-positive leukemia 
setting.

Activation of the MLL-ENL-ERtm oncogene initiates aberrant proliferation of 
myeloid progenitors. Here, we show induction of a fail-safe mechanism mediated 
by the DNA damage response (DDR) machinery that results in activation of the 
ATR/ATM-Chk1/Chk2-p53/p21(CIP1) checkpoint and cellular senescence at early 
stages of cellular transformation caused by a regulatable MLL-ENL-ERtm in mice. 
Furthermore, we identified the transcription program underlying this intrinsic 
anticancer barrier, and DDR-induced inflammatory regulators that fine-tune the 
signaling toward senescence, thereby modulating the fate of MLL-ENL-immortalized 
cells in a tissue-environment-dependent manner. Our results indicate that DDR is 
a rate-limiting event for acquisition of stem cell-like properties in 
MLL-ENL-ERtm-mediated transformation, as experimental inhibition of the barrier 
accelerated the transition to immature cell states and acute leukemia 
development.

The elongation stage of transcription is highly regulated in metazoans. We 
previously purified the AFF1- and AFF4-containing super elongation complex (SEC) 
as a major regulator of development and cancer pathogenesis. Here, we report the 
biochemical isolation of SEC-like 2 (SEC-L2) and SEC-like 3 (SEC-L3) containing 
AFF2 and AFF3 in association with P-TEFb, ENL/MLLT1, and AF9/MLLT3. The SEC 
family members demonstrate high levels of polymerase II (Pol II) C-terminal 
domain kinase activity; however, only SEC is required for the proper induction 
of the HSP70 gene upon stress. Genome-wide mRNA-Seq analyses demonstrated that 
SEC-L2 and SEC-L3 control the expression of different subsets of genes, while 
AFF4/SEC plays a more dominant role in rapid transcriptional induction in cells. 
MYC is one of the direct targets of AFF4/SEC, and SEC recruitment to the MYC 
gene regulates its expression in different cancer cells, including those in 
acute myeloid or lymphoid leukemia. These findings suggest that AFF4/SEC could 
be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of leukemia or other cancers 
associated with MYC overexpression.

Continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) are prone to inaccuracy due to time lags, 
sensor drift, calibration errors, and measurement noise. The aim of this study 
is to derive the model of the error of the second generation Medtronic Paradigm 
Veo Enlite (ENL) sensor and compare it with the Dexcom SEVEN PLUS (7P), G4 
PLATINUM (G4P), and advanced G4 for Artificial Pancreas studies (G4AP) systems. 
An enhanced methodology to a previously employed technique was utilized to 
dissect the sensor error into several components. The dataset used included 37 
inpatient sessions in 10 subjects with type 1 diabetes (T1D), in which CGMs were 
worn in parallel and blood glucose (BG) samples were analyzed every 15 ± 5 min 
Calibration error and sensor drift of the ENL sensor was best described by a 
linear relationship related to the gain and offset. The mean time lag estimated 
by the model is 9.4 ± 6.5 min. The overall average mean absolute relative 
difference (MARD) of the ENL sensor was 11.68 ± 5.07% Calibration error had the 
highest contribution to total error in the ENL sensor. This was also reported in 
the 7P, G4P, and G4AP. The model of the ENL sensor error will be useful to test 
the in silico performance of CGM-based applications, i.e., the artificial 
pancreas, employing this kind of sensor.

Sixteen out of 45 (36%) leprosy patients with clinical features of acute 
erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) did not show the characteristic presence of 
neutrophils (polymorphs) in histology of the ENL lesion. The acute-phase 
reactants, serum amyloid A (SAA) and C-reactive protein (CRP) which are systemic 
markers of inflammation, and IgM and IgG antibody to Mycobacterium leprae were 
determined in these patients in order to understand the differences in 
histological diagnosis. Both SAA and CRP were elevated in ENL patients, 
irrespective of the presence of polymorph infiltrates, as compared to 
nonreactional lepromatous patients, patients with histologically confirmed 
reversal reactions and endemic controls, indicating that all clinically 
diagnosed ENL patients had ongoing inflammatory reactions. On the other hand, 
IgM and IgG antibodies were significantly lower (> 70%) in ENL patients as 
compared to nonreactional lepromatous patients. When the two ENL groups 
[ENL-PMN+ve (positive for neutrophils) and ENL-PMN-ve (negative for 
neutrophils)] were compared, there were no significant differences in the mean 
SAA, IgM or IgG antibody concentrations, but CRP was eightfold lower in 
ENL-PMN-ve as compared to the ENL-PMN+ve group. This may indicate that the 
timing or modulation of the reaction was different in the two ENL groups. Thus, 
measurement of the acute-phase response and the ratio of SAA/CRP in particular 
are helpful in the clinical diagnosis of ENL reactions in leprosy.

Lessons of leprosy: the emergence of TH17 cytokines during type II reactions 
(ENL) is teaching us about T-cell plasticity.

BACKGROUND: Leprosy was the first disease classified according to the thymus 
derived T-cell in the 1960s and the first disease classified by the cytokine 
profile as intact interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and interleukin-2 (IL2) or TH1 
(tuberculoid) and deficient IFN-γ and IL2 or TH2 (lepromatous), in the 1980s.
OBJECTIVE: In the present study, we set out to explore the T helper 17 (TH17) 
lymphocyte subset, the hallmark of T-cell plasticity, in skin biopsies from 
patients with erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) who were treated with thalidomide.
METHOD: RNA was extracted from paraffin embedded tissue before and after 
thalidomide treatment of ENL and RT-PCR was performed.
RESULTS: IL17A, the hallmark of TH17, was consistently seen before and after 
thalidomide treatment, confirming the TH17 subset to be involved in ENL and 
potentially up-regulated by thalidomide.
CONCLUSION: A reduction in CD70, GARP, IDO, IL17B (IL-20), and IL17E (IL-25), 
coupled with increases in RORγT, ARNT, FoxP3, and IL17C (IL-21) following 
thalidomide treatment, opens the door to understanding the complexity of the 
immunomodulatory drug thalidomide, which can operate as an anti-inflammatory 
while simultaneously stimulating cell-mediated immunity (CMI). We conclude that 
TH17 is involved in the immunopathogenesis of ENL and that thalidomide 
suppresses inflammatory components of TH17, while enhancing other components of 
TH17 that are potentially involved in CMI.

High plant lignan intake is associated with a number of health benefits, 
possibly induced by the lignan metabolite enterolactone (ENL). The gut 
microbiota plays a crucial role in converting dietary lignans into ENL, and 
epidemiological studies have shown that use of antibiotics is associated with 
lower levels of ENL. Here we investigate the link between antibiotic use and 
lignan metabolism in pigs using LC-MS/MS. The effect of lignan intake and 
antibiotic use on the gut microbial community and the pig metabolome is studied 
by 16S rRNA sequencing and nontargeted LC-MS. Treatment with antibiotics 
resulted in substantially lower concentrations of ENL compared with 
concentrations detected in untreated animals, whereas the plasma concentrations 
of plant lignans were unchanged. Both diet and antibiotic treatment affected the 
clustering of urinary metabolites and significantly altered the proportions of 
taxa in the gut microbiota. Diet, but not antibiotic treatment, affected the 
plasma lipid profile, and a lower concentration of LDL cholesterol was observed 
in the pigs fed a high lignan diet. This study provides solid support for the 
associations between ENL concentrations and use of antibiotics found in humans 
and indicates that the lower ENL concentration may be a consequence of the 
ecological changes in the microbiota.

Luminescence imaging has gained attention as a promising bio-imaging modality in 
situations where fluorescence imaging cannot be applied. However, wider 
application to multicolour and dynamic imaging is limited by the lack of bright 
luminescent proteins with emissions across the visible spectrum. Here we report 
five new spectral variants of the bright luminescent protein, enhanced 
Nano-lantern (eNL), made by concatenation of the brightest luciferase, NanoLuc, 
with various colour hues of fluorescent proteins. eNLs allow five-colour 
live-cell imaging, as well as detection of single protein complexes and even 
single molecules. We also develop an eNL-based Ca2+ indicator with a 500% signal 
change, which can image spontaneous Ca2+ dynamics in cardiomyocyte and neural 
cell models. These eNL probes facilitate not only multicolour imaging in living 
cells but also sensitive imaging of a wide repertoire of proteins, even at very 
low expression levels.

disease status in leprosy.

BACKGROUND: Caused by Mycobacterium leprae (ML), leprosy presents a strong 
immune-inflammatory component, whose status dictates both the clinical form of 
the disease and the occurrence of reactional episodes. Evidence has shown that, 
during the immune-inflammatory response to infection, the growth 
hormone/insulin-like growth factor-I (GH/IGF-I) plays a prominent regulatory 
role. However, in leprosy, little, if anything, is known about the interaction 
between the immune and neuroendocrine systems.
METHODS: In the present retrospective study, we measured the serum levels of 
IGF-I and IGBP-3, its major binding protein. These measurements were taken at 
diagnosis in nonreactional borderline tuberculoid (NR BT), borderline 
lepromatous (NR BL), and lepromatous (NR LL) leprosy patients in addition to 
healthy controls (HC). LL and BL patients who developed reaction during the 
course of the disease were also included in the study. The serum levels of 
IGF-I, IGFBP-3 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) were evaluated at 
diagnosis and during development of reversal (RR) or erythema nodosum leprosum 
(ENL) reaction by the solid phase, enzyme-labeled, chemiluminescent-immunometric 
method.
RESULTS: The circulating IGF-I/IGFBP-3 levels showed significant differences 
according to disease status and occurrence of reactional episodes. At the time 
of leprosy diagnosis, significantly lower levels of circulating IGF-I/IGFBP-3 
were found in NR BL and NR LL patients in contrast to NR BT patients and HCs. 
However, after treatment, serum IGF-I levels in BL/LL patients returned to 
normal. Notably, the levels of circulating IGF-I at diagnosis were low in 75% of 
patients who did not undergo ENL during treatment (NR LL patients) in opposition 
to the normal levels observed in those who suffered ENL during treatment (R LL 
patients). Nonetheless, during ENL episodes, the levels observed in RLL sera 
tended to decrease, attaining similar levels to those found in NR LL patients. 
Interestingly, IGF-I behaved contrary to what was observed during RR episodes in 
R BL patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data revealed important alterations in the IGF system in 
relation to the status of the host immune-inflammatory response to ML while at 
the same time pointing to the circulating IGF-I/IGFBP-3 levels as possible 
predictive biomarkers for ENL in LL patients at diagnosis.

This study determined the effect of the mammalian lignans enterolactone (ENL) 
and enterodiol (END) alone and in combination with the isoflavone genistein 
(GEN) on the growth of MCF-7 tumors in ovariectomized nude mice. Ovariectomized 
athymic nude mice with established MCF-7 tumors were fed a basal diet (AIN-93G) 
and divided into 5 groups that received daily subcutaneous injections (10 mg/kg 
body weight (BW)) of ENL, END, GEN, a mixture of these compounds (MIX), or 
vehicle as a negative control for 22 weeks. A positive control group was 
implanted with an estradiol pellet in order to establish an estrogenic tumor 
growth response. In the ENL- and END-treated mice, palpable tumors regressed 
significantly by 91 and 83%, respectively, resulting in final tumors that were 
similar to the negative control tumors. However, tumor cell apoptosis was 
significantly enhanced by the lignans. In the GEN-treated mice, tumors initially 
regressed significantly by 64% but regression ceased following prolonged 
treatment, resulting in final tumors that were significantly larger compared to 
negative control, ENL-, and END-treated mice, in part by increasing tumor cell 
proliferation. The MIX treatment significantly regressed palpable tumors by 87% 
similar to negative control group, with no effects on tumor cell apoptosis or 
proliferation. The isoflavone GEN alone promoted the growth of established MCF-7 
human breast cancer xenografts after prolonged treatment while the mammalian 
lignans ENL and END did not. When these phytoestrogens were given in 
combination, no tumor growth-promoting effects were observed. (c) 2005

INTRODUCTION: Comparing multiple, diverse outcomes with cost-effectiveness 
analysis (CEA) is important, yet challenging in areas like palliative care where 
domains are unamenable to integration with survival. Generic multi-attribute 
utility values exclude important domains and non-health outcomes, while partial 
analyses-where outcomes are considered separately, with their joint relationship 
under uncertainty ignored-lead to incorrect inference regarding preferred 
strategies.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this paper is to consider whether such decision 
making can be better informed with alternative presentation and summary 
measures, extending methods previously shown to have advantages in multiple 
strategy comparison.
METHODS: Multiple outcomes CEA of a home-based palliative care model (PEACH) 
relative to usual care is undertaken in cost disutility (CDU) space and compared 
with analysis on the cost-effectiveness plane. Summary measures developed for 
comparing strategies across potential threshold values for multiple outcomes 
include: expected net loss (ENL) planes quantifying differences in expected net 
benefit; the ENL contour identifying preferred strategies minimising ENL and 
their expected value of perfect information; and cost-effectiveness 
acceptability planes showing probability of strategies minimising ENL.
RESULTS: Conventional analysis suggests PEACH is cost-effective when the 
threshold value per additional day at home (𝕜1) exceeds $1,068 or dominated by 
usual care when only the proportion of home deaths is considered. In contrast, 
neither alternative dominate in CDU space where cost and outcomes are jointly 
considered, with the optimal strategy depending on threshold values. For 
example, PEACH minimises ENL when 𝕜1=$2,000 and 𝕜2=$2,000 (threshold value for 
dying at home), with a 51.6% chance of PEACH being cost-effective.
CONCLUSION: Comparison in CDU space and associated summary measures have 
distinct advantages to multiple domain comparisons, aiding transparent and 
robust joint comparison of costs and multiple effects under uncertainty across 
potential threshold values for effect, better informing net benefit assessment 
and related reimbursement and research decisions.

[Immunosuppression in leprosy].

[Article in Spanish]

Sasiain MC, de la Barrera S.

Many authors tried to show that in lepromatous leprosy (LL), suppressor 
mechanisms are involved in the immune response. We have previously shown that 
non-specific suppression (Con A induced) was impaired in LL patients and tends 
to normalize during the erythema nodosum leprosum episode (ENL). In this system 
we have shown that CD8+ cells (Leu 2a+) can interfere with the generation of Con 
A-induced suppression. We also observed that a high percentage of LL patients 
had an increased spontaneous suppression. In these patients, the number of Leu 
2a+ cells added in the assay did not correlate with the suppression values. On 
the other hand, we had demonstrated that the monocyte suppressor system may have 
an important role, due to the release of soluble factors (PGE2). We evaluated M. 
leprae-induced suppressor cell function using a two step assay, on T cell 
proliferation. The results of this study indicate that the ability of M. leprae 
to induce suppressor activity was lower in LL patients than in tuberculoid (TT), 
intermediate clinical forms (BB, BL, BT) and BCG-immunized controls. On the 
other hand, we determined that the proportion of peripheral blood mononuclear 
cells (PBMC) bearing the Leu 8+ antigen (associated to suppressor inducer cells) 
was low in LL and tends to normalize during the ENL episode. Suppression of 
proliferation could not be overcome with exogenous IL-2 and was not related to 
the induction of Tac antigen. The ability of LL, TT, ENL and normal cells to 
proliferate upon PHA or Con A stimulus was similar.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250

The MLL gene is targeted by chromosomal translocations, which give rise to 
heterologous MLL fusion proteins and are associated with distinct types of acute 
lymphoid and myeloid leukaemia. To determine how MLL fusion proteins alter the 
proliferation and/or differentiation of primary haematopoietic progenitors, we 
introduced the MLL-AF9 and MLL-ENL fusion proteins into primary chicken bone 
marrow cells. Both fusion proteins caused the sustained outgrowth of immature 
haematopoietic cells, which was strictly dependent on stem cell factor (SCF). 
The renewing cells have a long in vitro lifespan exceeding the Hayflick limit of 
avian cells. Analysis of clonal cultures identified the renewing cells as 
immature, multipotent progenitors, expressing erythroid, myeloid, lymphoid and 
stem cell surface markers. Employing a two-step commitment/differentiation 
protocol involving the controlled withdrawal of SCF, the MLL-ENL-transformed 
progenitors could be induced to terminal erythroid or myeloid differentiation. 
Finally, in cooperation with the weakly leukaemogenic receptor tyrosine kinase 
v-Sea, the MLL-ENL fusion protein gave rise to multilineage leukaemia in chicks, 
suggesting that other activated, receptor tyrosine kinases can substitute for 
ligand-activated c-Kit in vivo.

Many studies have investigated the importance of the intestinal bacterial 
activation of individual phytoestrogens. However, human nutrition contains 
different phytoestrogens and the final exposure depends on the microbial 
potential to activate all different groups within each individual. In this work, 
interindividual variations in the bacterial activation of the different 
phytoestrogens were assessed. Incubation of feces from 100 individuals using 
SoyLife EXTRA, LinumLife EXTRA and isoxanthohumol suggested that individuals 
could be separated into high, moderate and low O-desmethylangolensin (O-DMA), 
equol, enterodiol (END), enterolactone (ENL) or 8-prenylnaringenin producers, 
but that the metabolism of isoflavones, lignans and prenylflavonoids follows 
separate, independent pathways. However, O-DMA and equol production correlated 
negatively, whereas a positive correlation was found between END and ENL 
production. In addition, END production correlated negatively with Clostridium 
coccoides-Eubacterium rectale counts. Furthermore, O-DMA production was 
correlated with the abundance of methanogens, whereas equol production 
correlated with sulfate-reducing bacteria, indicating that the metabolic fate of 
daidzein may be related to intestinal H(2) metabolism.

Erythema nodosum leprosum is associated with up-regulation of polyclonal IgG1 
antibody synthesis.

Erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) is a serious complication of lepromatous (L) 
disease in leprosy. We have previously shown that of the four IgG subclasses, 
IgG1 and IgG3 Mycobacterium leprae-specific antibodies are significantly lower 
in leprosy patients during ENL reaction compared with untreated L patients. To 
see if this decrease results from a down-regulation of antibody synthesis during 
ENL, the frequency of antibody-secreting B cells (ABSC) in the blood compartment 
was determined by ELISPOT and related to serum immunoglobulin concentrations 
(microgram/ABSC). Control groups consisted of 16 patients with stable L disease 
and 32 healthy endemic controls (EC). Paired samples were analysed during acute 
ENLS (n = 13) and after the reaction had subsided to identify changes associated 
with ENL. Polyclonal (PC) IgG1 was elevated in L patients compared with EC (325 
micrograms versus 180 micrograms). Interestingly, patients during acute ENL 
showed concentrations higher than L patients (419 micrograms), which decreased 
after the reaction had subsided (260 micrograms), indicating the transient 
nature of the antibody response. IgG2 antibodies showed the reverse trend and 
were lower during ENL and increased after the reaction had subsided. The mean 
concentrations for PC IgG3 and IgG4 antibodies were similar during ENL and after 
the reaction had subsided. Thus, decrease in M. leprae-specific IgG1 and IgG3 
antibodies is not related to down-regulation of B cell responses. Identification 
of factors which regulate PC IgG1 antibody synthesis may provide additional 
insights into determinants of ENL reactions.

School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.

Hansen's disease (HD) is rare in the United States, but a steady number of cases 
are diagnosed annually, especially in southern areas where armadillos are 
present. Challenges associated with erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL), a 
complication of multibacillary leprosy, call for novel regimens. We present a 
case of a man with recalcitrant ENL from HD likely acquired in the United 
States. He required a combination of 4 drugs to control chronic ENL.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the role of exogenous normal lymph (ENL) on 
lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung injury (ALI) in rats.
METHODS: ALI was induced by the jugular vein injection of LPS (iv, 15 mg/kg) in 
rats of the LPS and LPS+ENL groups within 15 min, then, ENL without cell 
components (5 ml/kg) was infused at the speed of 0.5 ml per minute in the 
LPS+ENL group, the same amount of saline was administered in the LPS group. The 
rats in the sham group received the same surgical procedure and saline. The 
histomorphology and the levels of P-selectin, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 
(ICAM-1), myeloperoxidase (MPO) in pulmonary tissue were assessed.
RESULTS: LPS induced pulmonary injury as well as increased the wet/dry weight 
ratio (W/D) and the levels of P-selectin, ICAM-1, and MPO in pulmonary tissues. 
These deleterious effects of LPS were significantly ameliorated by ENL 
treatment.
CONCLUSION: Exogenous normal lymph could markedly alleviate the acute lung 
injury induced by lipopolysaccharide, and its effects might be related to 
lessening the adhesion molecules.

MLL fusions are leukemogenic transcription factors that enhance transcriptional 
elongation through modification of chromatin and RNA Pol II. Global 
transcription rates and chromatin changes accompanying the transformation 
process induced by MLL-ENL were monitored by nascent RNA-seq and ChIP-seq, 
revealing 165 direct target genes separated into two distinct clades. ME5 genes 
bound MLL-ENL at the promoter, relied on DOT1L-mediated histone methylation, and 
coded preferentially for transcription factors, including many homeobox genes. A 
distinct ME3 group accumulated MLL-ENL beyond the termination site, was 
dependent on P-TEFb-mediated phosphorylation of RNA Pol II for transcription, 
and translated mainly into proteins involved in RNA biology and ribosome 
assembly. This dichotomy was reflected by a differential sensitivity toward 
small molecule inhibitors, suggesting the possibility of a combinatorial 
strategy for treatment of MLL-induced leukemia.

In vitro thalidomide does not interfere with the activation of complement by M. 
leprae.

State University, Baton Rouge, LA, USA. eshannon@hrsa.gov

Erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) is an inflammatory reaction that may occur in 
multibacillary leprosy patients, and thalidomide is the treatment of choice. Its 
cause and the mechanism by which thalidomide suppresses ENL are not known. In 
the skin lesions, im- mune complexes and split products of complement are found. 
The activation of complement could precipitate ENL, and thalidomide could 
suppress the inflammation by inhibiting the activation of complement. To 
determine if thalidomide could suppress the activation of complement, we first 
incubated normal serum with thalidomide and with M. leprae or zymosan. The 
amount of residual functional complement was then assessed by determining the 
dilution of serum required to lyses sheep erythrocytes sensitized by rabbit 
antibodies (CH50 Assay). M. leprae and zymosan activated complement. The 
residual complement activity in the serum incubated with M. leprae or with 
zymosan was equivalent to that incubated with M. leprae or zymosan in the 
presence of thalidomide, hydrolyzed thalidomide and metabolites of thalidomide. 
Thalidomide did not inhibit the activation of complement by zymosan, a known 
initiator of complement activation by the alternative pathway, or by M. leprae.

India.

Hypnotherapy is a useful adjunctive psychotherapeutic procedure used in various 
conditions such as pain disorders, atopic dermatitis, and alopecia areata. 
However, it is less utilized in the field of dermatology. Only limited data 
exist on its role in the management of various skin diseases. There is dearth of 
literature on the role of hypnotherapy in Hansen's disease (HD). We report two 
cases of HD, one with very resistant neuralgia and the other with recurrent 
erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL). Both the patients were assessed using hospital 
anxiety and depression scale, dermatology life quality index and the neuralgia 
was assessed using the visual analog scale. Three sessions of hypnotherapy were 
given to both the patients. There was dramatic improvement in the incidence of 
ENL and neuralgia and we could rapidly reduce the dose of drugs used for both 
conditions.

Oxidative metabolites of the mammalian lignans enterodiol and enterolactone in 
rat bile and urine.

Karlsruhe, P.O. Box 6980, GY-76128 Karlsruhe, Germany.

Recent studies have shown that the mammalian lignans enterodiol (END) and 
enterolactone (ENL) are biotransformed in vitro by hepatic microsomes from rats 
and humans to various metabolites carrying one additional hydroxy group either 
at the aromatic or at the aliphatic moiety. To clarify whether these metabolites 
are also formed in vivo, each lignan was administered intraduodenally at a dose 
of 10 mg/kg of bw to bile duct-catheterized female Wistar rats and the 6 h bile 
analyzed by HPLC and GC-MS. With END-dosed rats, three products of aromatic and 
two of aliphatic monohydroxylation were found, whereas six aromatic and five 
aliphatic monohydroxylated biliary metabolites were detected after 
administration of ENL. The metabolites hydroxylated at the aromatic rings were 
unequivocally identified by comparison with synthetic reference compounds. The 
structures of the in vivo metabolites arising from aliphatic hydroxylation could 
not be completely elucidated; they were identical with some of the formerly 
reported microsomal products according to GC retention times and mass spectra. 
Significant amounts of most of the metabolites of the mammalian lignans 
identified in bile were also found in the urine of female rats after oral 
administration of 10 mg/kg of bw END or ENL and in the urine of female and male 
Wistar rats after they had been fed a diet containing 5% flaxseed. Thus, the 
mammalian lignans END and ENL give rise to several hydroxylated metabolites in 
vivo, which may contribute to the biological effects of these important food 
constituents.

Human Polymerase-Associated Factor complex (PAFc) connects the Super Elongation 
Complex (SEC) to RNA polymerase II on chromatin.

The Super Elongation Complex (SEC), containing transcription elongation 
activators/coactivators P-TEFb, ELL2, AFF4/1, ENL, and AF9, is recruited by 
HIV-1 Tat and mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) proteins to activate the expression 
of HIV-1 and MLL-target genes, respectively. In the absence of Tat and MLL, 
however, it is unclear how SEC is targeted to RNA polymerase (Pol) II to 
stimulate elongation in general. Furthermore, although ENL and AF9 can bind the 
H3K79 methyltransferase Dot1L, it is unclear whether these bindings are required 
for SEC-mediated transcription. Here, we show that the homologous ENL and AF9 
exist in separate SECs with similar but nonidentical functions. ENL/AF9 contacts 
the scaffolding protein AFF4 that uses separate domains to recruit different 
subunits into SEC. ENL/AF9 also exists outside SEC when bound to Dot1L, which is 
found to inhibit SEC function. The YEATS domain of ENL/AF9 targets SEC to Pol II 
on chromatin through contacting the human Polymerase-Associated Factor complex 
(PAFc) complex. This finding explains the YEATS domain's dispensability for 
leukemogenesis when ENL/AF9 is translocated to MLL, whose interactions with PAFc 
and DNA likely substitute for the PAFc/chromatin-targeting function of the YEATS 
domain.

Leprosy, a spectral disease manifested on the basis of host immune responses, is 
complicated by its reactional stages, namely type I reversal reaction (RR) and 
type II erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL). These reactional stages are 
characterized by uncontrolled and aberrant immune responses. Biomarkers for 
reactional stages would aid in early diagnosis, efficient treatment, prevention 
of neurological complications and prediction of predisposition to reactional 
stages. In this study, comparative analysis of the serum proteome of leprosy 
patients by two-dimensional electrophoresis (2DE) followed by mass spectrometry 
showed differential expression of acute-phase protein alpha (1)-acid 
glycoprotein (AGP; also known as orosomucoid). AGP levels in untreated ENL cases 
were significantly higher than in lepromatous leprosy (LL; a non-reactional 
disease stage) (P=0.0126), RR (P=0.0176) and healthy controls (P=0.0030). These 
data were confirmed using ELISA. The levels of AGP decreased to normal levels 
after treatment with multidrug therapy and thalidomide (P =0.0167). In a 
follow-up study, AGP levels, which were high in the untreated ENL stage, 
decreased significantly at 5 days ( P=0.0084) and 21 days (P=0.0027) 
post-treatment. A stage-dependent increase in AGP in an LL patient who 
progressed into the ENL stage was also shown. Glycosylation analysis by 2DE 
showed differential expression of acidic glycoforms of AGP in untreated ENL 
cases. Changes in AGP concentration and differential expression of isoforms 
correlated with the inflammatory condition in ENL and also with the treatment 
regimen. Thus, initial validation of AGP as an ENL-specific biomarker and 
treatment indicator was shown in this study.

Acute myelogenous leukemia is driven by leukemic stem cells (LSCs) generated by 
mutations that confer (or maintain) self-renewal potential coupled to an 
aberrant differentiation program. Using retroviral mutagenesis, we identified 
genes that generate LSCs in collaboration with genetic disruption of the gene 
encoding interferon response factor 8 (Irf8), which induces a myeloproliferation 
in vivo. Among the targeted genes, we identified Mef2c, encoding a 
MCM1-agamous-deficiens-serum response factor transcription factor, and confirmed 
that overexpression induced a myelomonocytic leukemia in cooperation with Irf8 
deficiency. Strikingly, several of the genes identified in our screen have been 
reported to be up-regulated in the mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) subtype. High 
MEF2C expression levels were confirmed in acute myelogenous leukemia patient 
samples with MLL gene disruptions, prompting an investigation of the causal 
interplay. Using a conditional mouse strain, we demonstrated that Mef2c 
deficiency does not impair the establishment or maintenance of LSCs generated in 
vitro by MLL/ENL fusion proteins; however, its loss led to compromised homing 
and invasiveness of the tumor cells. Mef2c-dependent targets included several 
genes encoding matrix metalloproteinases and chemokine ligands and receptors, 
providing a mechanistic link to increased homing and motility. Thus, MEF2C 
up-regulation may be responsible for the aggressive nature of this leukemia 
subtype.

Sera of leprosy patients with type 2 reactions recognize selective sequences in 
Mycobacterium leprae recombinant LSR protein.

Type 2 reactions (erythema nodosum leprosum [ENL]) are episodic, reactional 
states causing significant morbidity in lepromatous leprosy patients. With a 
view to defining the immunological differences between the stable and reactional 
forms of lepromatous leprosy, we determined antibody responses to LSR, a 
recombinant protein of Mycobacterium leprae previously described by us (S. Laal, 
Y.D. Sharma, H.K. Prasad, A. Murtaza, S. Singh, S. Tangri, R. S. Mishra, and I. 
Nath, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88:1054-1058, 1991), as well as to 10- to 
15-mer overlapping peptides synthesized on the basis of the LSR amino acid 
sequence. We report here the selective recognition of B cell epitopes by sera 
from patients with ENL as compared with a control group with nonreactional 
lepromatous leprosy. Peptides 2 and 3, with the sequences GVTYEIDLTNKNAA and 
IDLTNKNAAKLRGD, respectively, were recognized by > 95% of sera from patients 
with active ENL. Peptide 3 in addition showed reactivity with sera taken from 
91.6% of lepromatous leprosy patients who were apparently stable but who were 
recorded to have had ENL several weeks before or after the sample collection. 
The core sequence IDLTNKNAA common to both these peptides may be a major target 
of humoral responses in ENL. In addition, the RGD motif at the C terminus 
appeared to influence the antigenicity of peptide 3 in enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay. It would appear that humoral responses during ENL are 
directed to selective antigenic determinants of the leprosy bacillus. The use of 
such serological markers to identify lepromatous leprosy patients with a high 
risk for developing ENL would be of clinical and predictive value.

OBJECTIVE: There is a positive correlation between higher serum phytoestrogen 
concentrations and lower risk of breast cancer. The activation of telomerase is 
crucial for the growth of cancer cells; therefore, the aim of this study was to 
examine the effects of enterolactone (ENL) and enterodiol (END) on this enzyme.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this experimental study, we performed the viability 
assay to determine the effects of different concentrations of ENL and END on 
cell viability, and the effective concentrations of these two compounds on cell 
growth. We used western blot analysis to evaluate human telomerase reverse 
transcriptase catalytic subunit (hTERT) expression and polymerase chain reaction 
(PCR)-ELISA based on the telomeric repeat amplification protocol (TRAP) assay 
for telomerase activity.
RESULTS: Both ENL and END, at 100 μM concentrations, significantly (P<0.05) 
reduced cell viability. However, only the 100 μM concentration of ENL 
significantly (P<0.05) decreased hTERT protein levels and telomerase activity. 
Lower concentrations of ENL did not have any significant effects on telomerase 
activity and hTERT protein levels.
CONCLUSION: High concentration of ENL decreased the viability of MCF-7 breast 
cancer cells and inhibited the expression and activity of telomerase in these 
cells. Although END could reduce breast cancer cell viability, it did not have 
any effect on telomerase expression and activity.

MLL-fusion proteins, AF9 and ENL, play an essential role in the recruitment of 
DOT1L and the H3K79 hypermethylation of MLL target genes, which is pivotal for 
leukemogenesis. Blocking these interactions may represent a novel therapeutic 
approach for MLL-rearranged leukemia. Based on the 7 mer DOT1L peptide, a class 
of peptidomimetics was designed. Compound 21 with modified middle residues, 
achieved significantly improved binding affinities to AF9 and ENL, with KD 
values of 15 nM and 57 nM, respectively. Importantly, 21 recognizes and binds to 
the cellular AF9 protein and effectively inhibits the AF9-DOT1L interactions in 
cells. Modifications of the N- and C-termini of 21 resulted in 28 with 2-fold 
improved binding affinity to AF9 and much decreased peptidic characteristics. 
Our study provides a proof-of-concept for development of nonpeptidic compounds 
to inhibit DOT1L activity by targeting its recruitment and the interactions 
between DOT1L and MLL-oncofusion proteins AF9 and ENL.

Endogenous gut nitrogen losses in growing pigs are not caused by increased 
protein synthesis rates in the small intestine.

The purpose of this study was to establish, using a flooding dose of L-[ring 2, 
6-(3)H] phenylalanine, whether feeding pigs diets that induce high endogenous 
gut nitrogen losses (ENL) also increases protein synthesis rates in (PSR) the 
visceral organs. Twelve 18-kg Yorkshire barrows with catheters in the right and 
left jugular veins were fed for 3 wk either casein-cornstarch- (CC) or 
barley-canola meal- (BCM) based diets formulated to a similar digestible energy 
/crude protein ratio and designed to induce either low or high ENL, 
respectively. Pigs were infused with 10 mL/kg body weight of a 150 mmol. L(-1) 
phenylalanine solution containing 230 MBq. L(-1) labeled phenylalanine for 12 
min and killed 20 min later. Plasma phenylalanine specific radioactivity (SRA) 
rose to a plateau value within 3 min of starting the infusion and did not change 
(P > 0.10) thereafter. Fractional rates of protein synthesis (K(s), %/d) based 
on SRA in plasma- or intracellular-free phenylalanine did not differ (P > 0.10) 
in all tissues except pancreas (P < 0.05). Diet affected K(s )in liver (P < 
0.01) and colon (P < 0.05) but not in pancreas, duodenum, jejunum and cecum. 
Based on plasma-free phenylalanine SRA, liver K(s)were 85.4 +/- 11.0 vs. 60.5 
+/- 5.2 (mean +/- SEM) in CC- and BCM-fed pigs, respectively; these values were 
82.3 +/- 4.7 vs. 98.2 +/- 5.8 in the colon. The absolute amount of protein 
synthesis (g.d(-1)) was higher in the liver (P < 0.05) and pancreas (P < 0. 05) 
of the CC pigs compared to BCM pigs. No dietary effects were observed in all 
other organs (P > 0.10). The present results suggest that feeding growing pigs a 
BCM diet that induces high ENL does not affect PSR in the small intestine of 
growing pigs from which >50% of ENL originates.

The MLL fusion proteins, AF9 and ENL, activate target genes in part via 
recruitment of the histone methyltransferase DOT1L (disruptor of telomeric 
silencing 1-like). Here we report biochemical, biophysical, and functional 
characterization of the interaction between DOT1L and MLL fusion proteins, 
AF9/ENL. The AF9/ENL-binding site in human DOT1L was mapped, and the interaction 
site was identified to a 10-amino acid region (DOT1L865-874). This region is 
highly conserved in DOT1L from a variety of species. Alanine scanning 
mutagenesis analysis shows that four conserved hydrophobic residues from the 
identified binding motif are essential for the interactions with AF9/ENL. 
Binding studies demonstrate that the entire intact C-terminal domain of AF9/ENL 
is required for optimal interaction with DOT1L. Functional studies show that the 
mapped AF9/ENL interacting site is essential for immortalization by MLL-AF9, 
indicating that DOT1L interaction with MLL-AF9 and its recruitment are required 
for transformation by MLL-AF9. These results strongly suggest that disruption of 
interaction between DOT1L and AF9/ENL is a promising therapeutic strategy with 
potentially fewer adverse effects than enzymatic inhibition of DOT1L for MLL 
fusion protein-associated leukemia.

Patients with leprosy may experience a chronic and severe type II leprosy 
reaction (ENL) erythema nodosum leprosum that may not respond to thalidomide and 
systemic immunosuppressants or may even cause serious adverse events. We here 
present four patients in whom anti-TNF-α therapy was used with successful 
results and compare our findings with other published cases. Four patients with 
chronic and severe ENL who did not respond to, at least, thalidomide and 
steroids (high doses) were followed up at two reference centers in Brazil. A 
thorough laboratory investigation was performed to exclude tuberculosis and 
other diseases before the start of immunobiological medication. Three patients 
were started on etanercept, and one patient was started on adalimumab. Of all 
patients, three developed severe adverse events resulting from the use of 
classical immunosuppressants for ENL (cataracts, deep vein thrombosis, diabetes, 
and osteoporosis). In all cases, a reduction in the number of ENL and, at least 
half of the immunosuppressant dose between 6 months and 2 years, were observed. 
Long-term follow-up of one patient revealed a dramatic reduction in hospital 
admissions due to ENL, from 12 instances in 1 year (before biologic therapy) to 
none (after biologic therapy), along with an improvement in condyloma 
acuminatum. In addition, no direct adverse events were observed with biologics. 
Treatment with anti-TNF-α therapy may be used as an alternative in patients with 
chronic and severe ENL who do not respond to traditional treatment (e.g., 
thalidomide, steroids, and other immunosuppressants). This treatment can help 
reduce the frequency of ENL, the immunosuppressive burden, and the number of 
hospital admissions.

Using methotrexate to treat patients with ENL unresponsive to steroids and 
clofazimine: a report on 9 patients.

Hossain D.

Erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) is a chronic recurrent systemic complication of 
multi-bacillary leprosy frequently associated with the development of neuritis, 
iritis, orchitis, arthritis and dactylitis. It is well managed by thalidomide, 
but thalidomide is not available in Bangladesh. The World Health Organization 
recommends high doses of clofazimine and prednisolone. About 19% of patients do 
not respond completely to this regimen or experience relapse when reducing 
steroid dosage.
OBJECTIVE: We undertook this study to determine whether oral prednisolone 
combined with methotrexate was an effective and safe treatment regimen for 
individuals with ENL resistant to clofazimine and prednisolone.
METHODOLOGY: Between September, 2006-June, 2011, we treated nine resistant ENL 
patients with a combination of prednisolone and methotrexate for 24-36 months 
with a mean duration of 30 months.
RESULT: We observed improvement leading to persistent remission of ENL in all 
our patients. Adverse effects were mild weight gain, weight gain with facial 
swelling, folliculitis and extensive Pityriasis versicolor infection in one 
patient and crusted scabies in another.
CONCLUSION: A combination of prednisolone and methotrexate was safe and 
effective in managing ENL not controlled by clofazimine and prednisolone.

    Ophthalmology. 1999 Apr;106(4):647-9.
    Ophthalmology. 2000 Jan;107(1):4-5.

OBJECTIVE AND DESIGN: The introduction of endonasal laser dacryocystorhinostomy 
(ENL-DCR) in the early 1990s showed great promise of changing 
dacryocystorhinostomy into an elegant, minimally invasive procedure from the 
traditional external dacryocystorhinostomy (EXT-DCR). This prospective, 
randomized study compares these two operations, their success rates, surgical 
durations, and postoperative symptoms.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 64 cases in 61 patients with primary acquired 
nasolacrimal sac or duct obstruction were divided into 2 subgroups by symptoms 
(simple epiphora and chronic dacryocystitis). These patients were randomized 
within both subgroups into 2 operation groups with 32 cases in each group.
INTERVENTION: Altogether, 32 EXT-DCRs and 32 ENL-DCRs were performed. The 
silicone tube was removed at 6 months after surgery. The final follow-up visit 
was at 1 year after surgery. The patency of the lacrimal passage was 
investigated by irrigation, and patients were questioned about their symptoms.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The patency of the lacrimal passage to irrigation and the 
duration of surgery were measured.
RESULTS: The success rate at 1 year after surgery was 91% for EXT-DCR and 63% 
for ENL-DCR after primary surgery. The difference was statistically significant 
(P = 0.016). The surgical duration for ENL-DCR was three times shorter than for 
EXT-DCR, the average duration being 23 minutes and 78 minutes, respectively (P < 
0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: The EXT-DCR, when compared with ENL-DCR, seems to provide superior 
operation results in primary acquired nasolacrimal duct obstruction.

A lignan complex isolated from flaxseed does not affect plasma lipid 
concentrations or antioxidant capacity in healthy postmenopausal women.

A lignan complex rich in the plant lignan secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG) 
was isolated from flaxseed. SDG is metabolized by the colonic microflora to the 
mammalian lignans enterodiol (END) and enterolactone (ENL), and was hypothesized 
to reduce plasma lipid concentrations and improve antioxidant capacity. The aim 
of this study was to investigate the effects of a lignan complex, providing 500 
mg/d of SDG, on serum concentration and urinary excretion of ENL, plasma lipids, 
serum lipoprotein oxidation resistance, and markers of antioxidant capacity. 
Healthy postmenopausal women (n = 22) completed a randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled, crossover study. Women consumed daily a low-fat muffin, with 
or without a lignan complex, for 6 wk, separated by a 6-wk washout period. Serum 
ENL concentration, urinary ENL excretion, plasma concentrations of total 
cholesterol (TC), LDL cholesterol (LDL-C), HDL cholesterol (HDL-C), 
triacylglycerol (TAG), serum lipoprotein oxidation lag time, plasma 
Trolox-equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC), and ferric reducing ability of 
plasma (FRAP) were measured at the beginning and end of each intervention 
period. ENL concentrations in serum (P < 0.001) and ENL urinary excretion (P < 
0.001) were significantly higher after the lignan complex intervention period 
compared with placebo. Plasma concentrations of TC, LDL-C, HDL-C, TAG, 
lipoprotein oxidation lag time, TEAC and FRAP were not affected. Daily 
consumption for 6 wk of a low-fat muffin enriched with a lignan complex 
significantly increased serum ENL concentrations and urinary ENL excretion in 
healthy postmenopausal women, but had no effect on plasma lipid concentrations, 
serum lipoprotein oxidation resistance, or plasma antioxidant capacity.

Increased chitotriosidase activity in serum of leprosy patients: association 
with bacillary leprosy.

Human phagocyte-specific chitotriosidase is associated with several diseases 
involving macrophage activation. Since macrophage activation plays an important 
role in the control of Mycobacterium leprae infection, we studied the 
association of chitotriosidase with leprosy both in serum and in situ in 
lesional skin biopsies from patients. Serum samples from 78 Indonesian leprosy 
patients (39 non-reactional and 39 reactional leprosy patients) and 36 healthy 
controls (HC) from the same endemic region were investigated. The patients were 
classified as multibacillary (MB, n=69) or paucibacillary (PB, n=9) based on the 
bacterial index in slit-skin smears. Thirty-six of the reactional patients had 
erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL), while only 3 had reversal reaction (RR). 
Follow-up serum samples after corticosteroid treatment were also obtained from 
17 patients with ENL and one with RR. Multibacillary (MB) patients showed 
increased chitotriosidase activity in serum as compared to paucibacillary (PB) 
patients and healthy controls. Although no significant difference was observed 
between reactional and the corresponding non-reactional groups, ENL showed 
significantly higher chitotriosidase activity as compared to HC. Furthermore, 
corticosteroid treatment resulted in significant decline of enzyme activity in 
ENL sera. Chitotriosidase activity correlated with levels of neopterin, another 
macrophage activation marker, but not with IL-6, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha and IL-10. 
Immunohistochemical staining of 6 MB (LL=5, BL=1) lesional skin sections from 
stored material showed positive staining for chitotriosidase within lipid-laden 
macrophages suggesting that macrophages are the source of the enzyme detected in 
serum. Thus, serum chitotriosidase activity is potentially useful in 
distinguishing MB from PB leprosy and in monitoring response to therapy in ENL.

As the epidemiological and physiological investigation of isoflavones and 
lignans expands, the need for sensitive methods for analyzing large numbers of 
samples intensifies. We have developed a method using high-performance liquid 
chromatography (HPLC) equipped with a coulometric electrode array detector for 
separation and sensitive detection of daidzein (Da), equol (Eq), genistein (Ge) 
and enterolactone (Enl) in dried blood spots (DBS). Detection limits ranged from 
4.5 pg or 0.09 ng/mL (Eq) to 19 pg or 0.38 ng/mL (Ge) on column. Signal 
linearities ranged from detection limits to 200 ng/mL (Eq, Enl) and 600 ng/mL 
(Da, Ge) sample concentration. Correlations between DBS and serum concentrations 
were 0.66 (Enl), 0.88 (Eq), 0.98 (Ge) and 0.99 (Da). Intra-assay coefficients of 
variation (CVs) were less than 8% and inter-assay CVs ranged from 2.4 to 20.2% 
for Da, Eq and Ge for three levels of controls. Enl intra-assay CV was 13.6% for 
the low pooled control. Analytic recovery ranged from 87% (inter-assay Ge) to 
98% (inter-assay Enl). DBS concentrations of Da, Ge and Eq were stable for at 
least 8 weeks at 4 and 25 degrees C, and at 37 degrees C for at least 5 weeks, 
with Enl showing greater variability at all temperatures but relative stability 
for 7 weeks. Measurement of samples from 135 perimenopausal Japanese women 
consuming habitual diets in Kyoto and Fukushima prefectures showed the former to 
have the expected lower concentrations of Da and Eq (416 and 87 nM) as well as 
Enl (49 nM) compared to the latter locale (566, 145 and 72 nM, respectively). 
This method could be useful in large epidemiological research or detailed 
physiological studies.

SCOPE: There is evidence that a mammalian lignan, enterolactone (ENL), decreases 
the proliferation rate of prostate cancer cells, although previous studies have 
used concentrations difficult to achieve through dietary modification. We have 
therefore investigated the anti-proliferative effects of ENL in an in vitro 
model of prostate tumourigenesis at concentrations reported to occur in a range 
of male populations.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The effects of 0.1 and 1 μM ENL on three markers of 
viability and proliferation (metabolic activity, growth kinetics, and cell cycle 
progression) were assessed in the RWPE-1, WPE1-NA22, WPE1-NB14, WPE1-NB11, 
WPE1-NB26, LNCaP, and PC-3 cell lines over 72 h. Based on these data, we 
quantified the expression levels of 12 genes involved in the control of DNA 
replication initiation using TaqMan real-time PCR in the WPE1-NA22, WPE1-NB14, 
WPE1-NB11, and WPE1-NB26 cell lines. ENL significantly inhibited the abnormal 
proliferation of the WPE1-NB14 and WPE1-NB11 cell lines and appears to be a 
consequence of decreased expression of abnormal chromatin licensing and DNA 
replication factor 1.
CONCLUSION: In contrast to previous studies, concentrations of ENL that are 
reported after dietary intervention restrict the proliferation of early-stage 
tumourigenic prostate cell lines by inhibiting the abnormal formation of 
complexes that initiate DNA replication.

India.

Erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) or type 2 lepra reaction is an inflammatory 
reaction, which may occur in the course of hanseniasis, may compel the patient 
to seek medical attention and may result in nerve function impairment and 
subsequent disability. Thus, recognition and timely management of these patients 
is critical in order to avoid permanent disability. Fine-needle aspiration 
cytology is simple and effective tool that aids in the correct diagnosis and 
management of ENL. Herein, we present two cases of ENL, one with typical and 
another with atypical presentation.

treatment of type II reaction in leprosy.

Type II reaction in leprosy, or erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL), is often 
characterized by severe clinical symptoms together with nerve function 
impairment leading to permanent disabilities. Thalidomide has been shown to be a 
highly effective drug for the treatment of ENL. It is, however, contraindicated 
for women of childbearing age due to its teratogenicity. On the other hand, 
pentoxifylline, used to treat hypercoagulable states, is not teratogenic and, 
like thalidomide, can inhibit the synthesis of tumor necrosis factor-a and other 
cytokines. In the present randomized double-blind clinical study we compared the 
effectiveness of orally administered pentoxifylline vs thalidomide in treating 
type II reaction in 44 patients. Daily doses of 300 mg thalidomide or 1.2 g 
pentoxifylline were administered for 30 days to multibacillary leprosy patients 
undergoing type II reaction. Randomly chosen patients were included in the study 
before, during, and after specific multidrug therapy. Clinical evaluations were 
performed on the 1st, 7th, 14th, 21st, and 30th days of treatment and laboratory 
tests were carried out on the 1st and 30th days. As expected, overall, 
thalidomide proved to be more effective in the treatment of type II leprosy 
reaction. Nevertheless, continuous treatment with pentoxifylline was effective 
in relieving the clinical signs of ENL, especially limb edema and systemic 
symptoms, in 62.5% of the patients.

Treatment of erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL, type 2 reaction) using thalidomide 
provides effective alternative choice to steroid therapy. Yet, the Japanese 
National Health Insurance approves thalidomide prescription only for the 
treatment of multiple myeloma under the Thalidomide Education and Risk 
Management System (TERMS). Benefit of thalidomide therapy for patients with ENL 
is already an established fact based on various reports from other countries, 
but limited experiences and standards in Japan have hindered application of the 
medication to our patients. This led us to compose a local guideline. Based on 
and following the TERMS, we suggest starting thalidomide from 50-100 mg/day and 
then onwards adjusting the dose according to the symptoms of each patient, not 
to exceed the maximum recommended dose of 300 mg/day, for the treatment of ENL.

This paper presents epidemiological data on reversal reaction (RR) and erythema 
nodosum leprosum reaction (ENL) from a retrospective study of 386 leprosy 
patients newly registered at Green Pastures Hospital, Pokhara, West Nepal. The 
average follow-up time was 21 months. The prevalence of RR at first examination 
was 28% (23-32), and the prevalence of ENL reaction was 5.7% (2.3-9.2). The 
overall incidence rates among the 335 patients that were available for follow-up 
were 8.7 (6.5-12)/100 person years at risk (PYAR) for RR and 3.2 (1.5-6.7)/100 
PYAR for ENL. Relapse of RR was common (1.4/patient). In all, 52% of RR were 
complicated by new nerve function impairment, against 59% of ENL reactions. The 
finding of other investigators that most RRs occur during the first year of 
treatment was confirmed by this study. The most significant risk factor for RR 
was extent of clinical disease measured by a count of body areas with clinical 
signs of leprosy. The risk of developing a RR for patients with 'extensive 
disease' (3 or more out of 9 body areas involved) was 10 times that of patients 
with limited disease (Rate Ratio 10 (1.3-76), p = 0.026). The study indicated 
that the following categories of patients in Nepal are at high or increased risk 
of developing a RR: 1, borderline patients during their first year of MDT; and 
2, patients with more extensive clinical disease as described above.

Lepromatous leprosy patients often develop erythema nodusum leprosum (ENL) 
reactions mainly during treatment of the disease. Hence, this study sought to 
investigate correlation between the prevalence of certain autoantibodies and ENL 
reactions in these patients. The patients included in the study were fifty 
patients with lepromatous leprosy and a similar number of normal controls. Sera 
were collected from the patients and normal controls and the prevalence of 
circulating rheumatoid factor antinuclear and antismooth muscle antibodies was 
determined. The prevalence of autoantibodies was increased in lepromatous 
leprosy as compared with normal controls. The prevalence of these autoantibodies 
were affected differently by the ENL reactions. ENL lepromatous leprosy showed a 
slight decrease in prevalence of antinuclear and antismooth muscle antibodies, 
whereas there was a slight increase in the prevalence of rheumatoid factor in 
ENL lepromatous leprosy. The levels of serum immunoglobulins tended to show a 
decline towards ENL lepromatous patients compared with the uncomplicated 
lepromatous patients. The significance of these finding is discussed in relation 
to their possible role in the pathogenesis of ENL reaction. It is concluded that 
some of these autoantibodies and immunoglobulins may be utilized during ENL 
reactions in the formation of immune complexes.

Immune complexes and antibody levels in blisters over human leprosy skin lesions 
with or without erythema nodosum leprosum.

Erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) is a serious complication of lepromatous 
leprosy, affecting skin and peripheral nerves in a large percentage of these 
patients, and is presumed to result from spontaneous immunologic changes. Its 
pathogenesis is poorly understood, although histopathologic features have 
suggested immune complex (IC)-mediated injury. Abundant circulating antibody is 
present but no convincing correlation has been established between circulating 
IC and ENL. We have examined cutaneous leprosy lesions in vivo using blisters 
induced by prolonged gentle suction to determine whether or not IC are 
demonstrable in lesions with or without ENL, using an IC assay based on 
monoclonal rheumatoid factor binding. We also examined whether antibodies 
involved in such IC are produced locally or reach the skin via the circulation. 
Surprisingly large quantities of IC were found in ENL lesions, and in some cases 
the quantities were significantly higher than in matching serum. Total IgG, IgA, 
and IgM in the skin were not higher than expected, however. Attempts to 
demonstrate increases in intracutaneous levels of specific anti-Mycobacterium 
leprae antibodies were unsuccessful. This is the first report of the 
demonstration of IC in suction blister fluid. The results indicate that large 
quantities of IC may be present in cutaneous leprosy lesions and are consistent 
with the hypothesis that they are formed in situ when circulating antibody 
combines with antigen in the skin. The nature of the antigen in these IC remains 
undefined.

INTRODUCTION: Erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) is an inflammatory reaction, which 
may occur in the course of leprosy and may result in nerve function impairment 
and subsequent disability.
METHODS: This retrospective study explores demographic and disease specific 
parameters. Severity of ENL was assessed using the Reaction Severity Scale 
(RSS). Records of 94 patients were reviewed. The study reports also on the 
treatment of 76 of these patients who were treated with prednisolone alone or 
thalidomide in addition to prednisolone. RESULTS Thirty percent of patients 
presented with ENL at time of diagnosis; 41% developed ENL-reaction in the first 
year of MDT. Forty-eight percent of patients were treated for ENL-reaction for 
less than 12 months; 13% for more than 5 years. High RSS-scores correlated with 
a longer duration of treatment. In group A (prednisolone) 51.7% and in group B 
(prednisolone and thalidomide) 76.6% of patients were male. Age, leprosy 
classification, delay of multidrug treatment (MDT) and interval between MDT and 
first ENL-symptoms did not differ significantly in both groups. Median duration 
of ENL-treatment was 15 months in group A versus 38 months in group B (P < 
0.001). At the start of treatment, ENL-reaction was less severe in group A (RSS 
= 12) than in group B (RSS = 18; P = 0.003).
DISCUSSION: ENL-symptoms may be of help in the early diagnosis and adequate 
treatment of ENL. Characterisation of (sub) groups of patients with ENL based on 
presence and severity of symptoms is important for future prospective studies to 
better evaluate the efficacy of interventions.

ENL, the MLL fusion partner in t(11;19), binds to the c-Abl interactor protein 1 
(ABI1) that is fused to MLL in t(10;11)+.

Translocations of the chromosomal locus 11q23 that disrupt the MLL gene 
(alternatively ALL-1 or HRX) are frequently found in children's leukemias. These 
events fuse the MLL amino terminus in frame with a variety of unrelated 
proteins. Up to date, 16 different fusion partners have been characterized and 
more are likely to exist. No general unifying property could yet be detected 
amongst these proteins. We show here that the frequent MLL fusion partner ENL at 
19p13.1 interacts with the human homologue of the mouse Abl-Interactor 1 (ABI1) 
protein. ABI1 in turn, is fused to MLL in the t(10;11)(p11.2;q23) translocation. 
ABI1 was identified as an ENL binding protein by a yeast two-hybrid screen. The 
interaction of ENL and ABI1 could be verified in vitro by far-Western blot 
assays and GST-pulldown studies as well as in vivo by co-immunoprecipitation 
experiments. A structure-function analysis identified an internal region of ENL 
and a composite motif of ABI1 including an SH3 domain as mutual binding 
partners. These data introduce novel aspects that might contribute to the 
understanding of the process of leukemogenesis by MLL fusion proteins.

Lepromatous leprosy masquerading as acute sarcoidosis: a case report and 
literature review.

Leprosy is uncommon in North America. Because it has a prolonged incubation 
period and can masquerade with a variety of manifestations, many patients with 
leprosy experience a significant delay in diagnosis and treatment. Lepra 
reactions are of 2 types: reversal (type 1) and erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) 
(type 2). Type 1 or reversal reactions represent an increase in cell-mediated 
immunity, whereas type 2 or ENL is caused by antigen-antibody complex formation 
and deposition after antigen release from dying lepra bacilli. This article 
describes the diagnostic challenges presented by a Minnesota patient eventually 
found to have lepromatous leprosy. That challenge was compounded by the fact 
that the clinical scenario closely mimicked connective tissue/immune complex 
disease and by the fact that the patient presented in a location where the 
incidence and prevalence of leprosy is extremely low.

The enl mutants enhance the lrx1 root hair mutant phenotype of Arabidopsis 
thaliana.

The development of root hairs serves as an excellent model to study cell growth 
using both cytological and genetic approaches. In the past, we have 
characterized LRX1, an extracellular protein of Arabidopsis consisting of an 
LRR-domain and a structural extensin domain. LRX1 is specifically expressed in 
root hairs and lrx1 mutants show severe deficiencies in root hair development. 
In this work, we describe the characterization of enl (enhancer of lrx1) mutants 
that were isolated in a visual screen of an ethylmethanesulfonate -mutagenized 
lrx1 line for plants exhibiting an enhanced lrx1 phenotype. Four recessive enl 
mutants were analyzed, three of which define new genetic loci involved in root 
hair development. The mutations at the enl loci and lrx1 result in additive 
phenotypes in enl/lrx1 double mutants. One enl mutant is affected in the ACTIN2 
gene and encodes a protein with a 22 amino acid deletion at the C-terminus. The 
comparison of molecular and phenotypic data of different actin2 alleles suggests 
that the truncated ACTIN2 protein is still partially functional.

Selective decrease of M. leprae-specific IgG1 and IgG3 antibodies in leprosy 
patients associated with ENL.

Kifayet A(1), Hussain R.

Erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) is a serious complication of lepromatous 
leprosy. Because of the similarities with the Arthus-type reaction, ENL is 
presumed to be due to immune complex formation and their deposition in tissues. 
The aim of this study was to dissect the antibody response at the IgG subclass 
level to ascertain differences in IgG subclasses in nonreactional 
lepromatous/borderline lepromatous (LL/BL) patients and reactional (ENL) 
lepromatous patients. The ENL group showed significantly lower serum antibody 
levels for the four subclasses compared to the LL/BL group of patients using the 
Mann-Whitney U test (IgG1, p = 0.0001; IgG2, p = 0.0009; IgG3, p = 0.0001; IgG4, 
p = 0.03). Since the majority of ENL patients (54 of 67) had received leprosy 
chemotherapy for varying durations of time, LL/BL patients were also compared 
with 19 ENL patients who had received < or = 2 weeks of chemotherapy. In this 
group only IgG1 (p = 0.048) and IgG2 (p = 0.001) antibodies showed significantly 
lower concentrations. Immunoblotting analysis demonstrated that in ENL patients 
IgG1 showed a selective disappearance of several antigenic bands recognized by 
the LL/BL serum pool; while most of the antigens recognized by IgG3 antibodies 
in the LL/BL serum pool were not detected in the ENL serum pool or in the sera 
of pretreated individual ENL patients. These results suggest that IgG1 and IgG3 
may be the most pathogenic IgG subclass antibodies during ENL, and their 
deposition in tissues could initiate the complement-mediated inflammatory 
pathway resulting in the clinical disease associated with ENL.

Erythema nodosum leprosum in Singapore.

Giam YC(1), Ong BH, Tan T.

Author information:
(1)Middle Road Hospital, Singapore.

Erythema Nodosum Leprosum (ENL) or Type II reaction is an immune complex 
syndrome seen in multibacillary leprosy. 20 patients with histological 
confirmation of ENL in leprosy were studied from 1982 to 1986. These patients 
had a range of clinical signs, from fever, tender dusky nodules, bullae, ulcers 
to lymphadenopathy, arthralgia and neuritis. The four major histological 
patterns are: a) classical pattern showing heavy infiltrations of neutrophils in 
three cases, b) sub-epidermal bulla pattern with marked oedema of the upper 
dermis, and collections of neutrophils in five cases, c) vasculitis pattern, 
affecting superficial and mid-dermal vessels, leading to epidermal necrosis, 
bulla formation and ulceration. Dilated vessels, congestion, lumenal fibrin 
clots and fibrinoid necrosis of vessels were seen, d) non-specific picture in 
nine cases with mild oedema, infiltration with neutrophils, and two cases with 
minimal reaction had chronic ENL with clinical vasculitis. All the five cases 
with vasculitis showed C1q, C3 and fibrinogen in the vessels. Comparing ENL 
reactions reported in Asia, our pattern is similar to that of Malaysians with 
the majority showing sub-epidermal oedema. Vasculitis is more common in India. 
Oedema with collagen necrosis as seen in acute ENL with iritis in New Guinea. 
The Lucio's phenomenon was not seen in any of the countries in Asia.

Changes in hemoglobin (HGB) and serum albumin (SA) concentration associated with 
the onset of symptomatic erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) were studied by 
comparing the values obtained on the day thalidomide or prednisone therapy 
commenced, with each patients' preceding values. In three groups of ENL patients 
mean HGB values fell with statistical significance: 1) in 38 patients who had 
been begun on thalidomide in the decade of the 1990s and who had been receiving 
dapsone for a minimum of 6 months, mean HGB values fell from 13.19 gm/dl to 
12.27 gm/dl, or 7.0%, p = 6.0 x 10(-6); 2) in 8 patients who were in the active 
patient file not overlapping with the preceding group, and who had been on 
dapsone for a minimum of 6 months, mean HGB values feel from 13.40 gm/dl to 
11.96 gm/dl, or 10.7%, p = 0.0015; and 3) in 8 patients not overlapping with the 
preceding groups, who were treated with rifampin and minocylcine or 
clarithromycin mean HGB values fell from 13.25 gm/dl to 12.48 gm/dl, or 5.8%, p 
= 0.0035. In two groups of ENL patients SA values also fell with statistical 
significance: 1) in 34 patients who were begun on thalidomide in the decade of 
the 1990s and who had been on dapsone for a minimum of 6 months, mean SA values 
fell from 4.14 gm/dl to 3.77 gm/dl, or 8.9%, p = 1.2 x 10(-5); and 2) in 10 
patients from the active file not overlapping with the preceding group, and who 
had been on dapsone for a minimum of 6 months, mean SA values fell from 4.45 
gm/dl to 4.06 gm/dl, or 8.8%, p = 0.039. A brisk fall in HGB values was often 
accompanied by a fall in SA concentration, and vice versa. Recovery from extreme 
falls in HGB and SA values was complete in 13 weeks. Recovery occurred in the 
presence of continued dapsone treatment. The falls could be rapid, occurring too 
soon to be the result of decreased erythropoiesis or hepatic SA synthesis. This 
study provides no direct evidence as to the mechanism responsible for the fall 
in these two parameters, but an interleukin-6 mediated hemodilution is an 
attractive hypothesis. The ENL-associated fall in HGB values was distinct from 
dapsone-induced hemolysis and the anemia of chronic disease. The ENL-associated 
anemia is not a good reason to discontinue dapsone therapy.

Effects of thalidomide on intracellular Mycobacterium leprae in normal and 
activated macrophages.

Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, LA 70803, USA.

Thalidomide is an effective drug for the treatment of erythema nodosum leprosum 
(ENL). ENL is an inflammatory reaction that may occur in multibacillary leprosy 
patients. Its cause(s) as well as the mechanism of thalidomide in arresting this 
condition are not fully understood. It has been suggested that ENL is an immune 
complex-mediated hypersensitivity precipitated by the release of Mycobacterium 
leprae from macrophages. The released antigen may complex with precipitating 
antibodies, initiating complement fixation and the production of inflammatory 
cytokines like tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha). Thalidomide has been 
shown in vitro to reduce antigen- or mitogen-activated macrophage production of 
TNF-alpha. We investigated if thalidomide could also influence the viability of 
intracellular M. leprae. Mouse peritoneal macrophages were infected with M. 
leprae, activated with gamma interferon and endotoxin, or nonactivated, and 
treated with thalidomide. Intracellular bacilli were recovered, and metabolic 
activity was assessed by a radiorespirometric procedure. Thalidomide did not 
possess antimicrobial action against M. leprae in normal and activated host 
macrophages. This suggests that thalidomide does not retard the release of 
mycobacterial antigens, a possible prelude or precipitating factor for ENL. A 
distinct sequence of events explaining the mechanism of action for thalidomide's 
successful treatment of ENL has yet to be established.

AIMS: To assess the accuracy and reliability of the two most widely used 
continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems.
METHODS: We studied the Dexcom®G4 Platinum (DG4P; Dexcom, San Diego, CA, USA) 
and Medtronic Paradigm Veo Enlite system (ENL; Medtronic, Northridge, CA, USA) 
CGM systems, in 24 patients with type 1 diabetes. The CGM systems were tested 
during 6-day home use and a nested 6-h clinical research centre (CRC) visit. 
During the CRC visit, frequent venous blood glucose samples were used as 
reference while patients received a meal with an increased insulin bolus to 
induce an aggravated postprandial glucose nadir. At home, patients performed at 
least six reference capillary blood measurements per day. A Wilcoxon signed-rank 
test was performed using all data points ≥15 min apart.
RESULTS: The overall mean absolute relative difference (MARD) value [standard 
deviation (s.d.)] measured at the CRC was 13.6 (11.0)% for the DG4P and 16.6 
(13.5)% for the ENL [p < 0.0002, confidence interval of difference (CI Δ) 
1.7-4.3%, n = 530]. The overall MARD assessed at home was 12.2 (12.0)% for the 
DG4P and 19.9 (20.5)% for the ENL (p < 0.0001, CI Δ = 5.8-8.7%, n = 839). During 
the CRC visit, the MARD in the hypoglycaemic range [≤3.9 mmol/l (70 mg/dl)], was 
17.6 (12.2)% for the DG4P and 24.6 (18.8)% for the ENL (p = 0.005, CI Δ 
3.1-10.7%, n = 117). Both sensors showed higher MARD values during hypoglycaemia 
than during euglycaemia [3.9-10 mmol/l (70-180 mg/dl)]: for the DG4P 17.6 versus 
13.0% and for the ENL 24.6 versus 14.2%.
CONCLUSIONS: During circumstances of intended use, including both a CRC and home 
phase, the ENL was noticeably less accurate than the DG4P sensor. Both sensors 
showed lower accuracy in the hypoglycaemic range. The DG4P was less affected by 
this negative effect of hypoglycaemia on sensor accuracy than was the ENL.

Serum levels of tumour necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1 beta during 
leprosy reactional states.

The possible role of cytokines in leprosy reactions was investigated by 
analysing the levels of tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin-1 (IL-1) in 
serum samples from 39 leprosy patients, 22 of them presenting either type I 
(upgrading) or type II (ENL) reactions. Fifty per cent of the patients showed 
elevated concentrations of TNF and IL-1 in at least one of the serum samples 
tested. This included all four patients undergoing type I reversal reaction and 
nine (50%) of the ENL patients studied. Concentrations of TNF above 1000 pg/ml 
were found in four patients with ENL. Development of erythema multiforme in 
these ENL patients represented an aggravating factor and all four patients 
suffering from this type of lesion demonstrated increased serum TNF levels. All 
BT patients tested presented elevated IL-1 levels, while only half of them 
presented elevated levels of TNF. No correlation was found between any 
particular systemic symptoms and the levels of TNF and IL-1. These results 
suggest that TNF and IL-1 may be implicated in leprosy reactions, either acting 
directly or in synergism with other cytokines.

MLL (also known as ALL-I, HTRX, or HRX) gene translocations are among the most 
common chromosomal abnormalities recognized in both B-lineage acute 
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, MLL gene 
rearrangements are uncommon in T-cell ALL. We recently detected an MLL gene 
rearrangement in a patient with typical T-cell ALL. We recently detected an MLL 
gene rearrangement in a patient with typical T-cell ALL (CD2+, CD4+, CD5+, CD7+, 
CD8+, HLA DR-) and an apparently normal karyotype (46,XX). The rearrangement was 
cloned and characterized; a DNA fragment distal to the breakpoint was mapped by 
fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to 19p13, indicating that the leukemic 
blasts had undergone a cytogenetically undetected rearrangement involving 
chromosomes 11 and 19. A reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction 
(RT-PCR) assay demonstrated an in-frame fusion mRNA between the amino terminus 
of MLL and the carboxy terminus of ENL (also known as MLLT1 or LTG19), a gene 
that has been mapped to 19p13. In addition, MLL sequences distal (telomeric) to 
the breakpoint were deleted from the genome, which precludes the formation of a 
reciprocal ENL/MLL fusion protein. These findings suggest that an MLL/ENL fusion 
protein (and not a reciprocal ENL/MLL fusion) was likely to be pathogenic in 
this patient, and they reinforce previous studies showing that leukemic blasts 
with apparently normal karyotype may harbor MLL rearrangements. Additionally, 
this report provides the first conclusive evidence of an MLL/ENL gene fusion 
characterized at a molecular level in a patient with T-cell ALL.

Erythema Nodosum Leprosum (ENL) may have a chronic course which may be 
recalcitrant to treatment. Preferred treatment modalities are systemic 
corticosteroids and thalidomide. Azathioprine, methotrexate and cyclosporine are 
immunosuppressants which may also be used as a steroid sparing agent. We report 
the case of a 48-year-old male diagnosed as lepromatous leprosy that developed 
ENL after four months of Multibacillary Multi-Drug Therapy (MB-MDT). He was 
treated with oral prednisolone (1 mg/kg/day) which was gradually tapered upto a 
dose of 7.5 mg/day. He developed recurrences on and off once the dose reached 
the said level and this continued for three years. Oral clofazamine (300 mg/day 
x 6 months; then 100 mg/day x 6 months) was also added in the second year. 
Thalidomide (200 mg/day) was also given but withdrawn due to adverse effect 
after 10 days. Azathioprine was started at a dose of 100 mg/day following which 
there was resolution of symptoms by one week and no recurrences by 10 weeks; it 
was given for eight months after which the dose was tapered to 50 mg/day for 
another four months. Complete withdrawal of oral prednisolone after gradual 
tapering was possible by 12 months of azathioprine therapy. The patient is still 
on regular follow-up with no recurrences so far till the last check-up.

Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) occurs as an acute 
symptomatic expression of a latent infection during the recovery of immune 
system in response to antiretroviral therapy in HIV patients. IRIS triggers both 
opportunistic and non-opportunistic infections. We report a case of IRIS in a 
patient with HIV, presenting as erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL), which led to 
unmasking of lepromatous leprosy following anti-retroviral therapy (ART).

Effect of cyclosporine A in erythema nodosum leprosum.

Uyemura K, Dixon JF, Wong L, Rea TH, Modlin RL.

Erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) is a reactional state of lepromatous leprosy in 
which the loss of suppressor cell function, decrease in suppressor cell numbers, 
and increase of interleukin 2 production are observed. We reasoned that 
cyclosporine A (CsA), by opposing these immune responses, could suppress the ENL 
reaction and restore patients to the quiescent lepromatous state. We tested this 
hypothesis in vitro by measuring the effect of CsA on M. leprae-triggered 
suppressor cells. In 24 of 25 patients with ENL, suppressor cell activity was 
restored by CsA. The target of CsA appeared to be macrophages. These findings 
are significant in that they provide the first evidence for the potential 
efficacy of CsA in the treatment of ENL. Preliminary clinical trials indicate a 
beneficial therapeutic effect associated with increased T suppressor cells in 
lesions.

Enterolactone and estradiol inhibit each other's proliferative effect on MCF-7 
breast cancer cells in culture.

Mousavi Y(1), Adlercreutz H.

Finland.

In earlier studies it has been shown that women with breast cancer and at risk 
for breast cancer have low excretion of urinary mammalian lignans (enterolactone 
and enterodiol) mainly due to low intake of whole-grain products and other 
fiber-rich foods. It is well known that estradiol (E2) has proliferative effects 
on estrogen dependent cancer cells and that antiestrogens inhibit this effect. 
To elucidate whether enterolactone (Enl) has antiestrogenic properties we 
studied, using MCF-7 breast cancer cells in culture, the in vitro effect of 
relatively low concentrations of Enl added both alone and in combination with 
E2. E2 (1 nmol/l) and Enl (0.5-2 mumol/l) separately stimulated the 
proliferation of MCF-7 cells, but their combination always resulted in lower 
stimulation than any of them alone, or the combined compounds had no stimulatory 
effect at all compared to the control. Higher concentrations above 10 mumol/l of 
Enl inhibited significantly the growth of the cells suggesting a toxic effect. 
The lignan was very rapidly conjugated to its monosulfate. It is suggested that 
one possible mechanism by which Enl may affect the growth of these estrogen 
sensitive cells is by competition of Enl and its sulfate with the estrogens for 
sulfokinases and sulfatases involved in estrogen metabolism in the cells. It is 
concluded that Enl inhibits E2-stimulated MCF-7 breast cancer cell growth in 
vitro, and vice versa. The concentrations of Enl needed for the elimination of 
the proliferative effect of E2 are physiologic and similar to those used in 
corresponding experiments utilizing tamoxifen.

Thalidomide suppressed IL-1beta while enhancing TNF-alpha and IL-10, when cells 
in whole blood were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide.

Thalidomide is used to treat erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL). The events that 
precipitate this inflammatory reaction, which may occur in multibacillary 
leprosy patients, and the mechanism by which thalidomide arrest ENL, are not 
known. Thalidomide's ability to inhibit tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) 
in vitro has been proposed as a partial explanation of its effective treatment 
of ENL. In in vitro assays, thalidomide can enhance or suppress TNF-alpha. This 
is dependent on the stimulant used to evoke TNF-alpha; the procedure used to 
isolate the mononuclear cells from blood, and the predominant mononuclear cell 
type in the culture. To avoid artifacts that may occur during isolation of 
mononuclear cells from blood, we stimulated normal human blood with LPS and 
evaluated the effect of thalidomide and dexamethasone on TNF-alpha, and other 
inflammatory cytokines and biomarkers. Thalidomide suppressed interleukin 1 beta 
(IL-1beta) (p = 0.007), and it enhanced TNF-alpha (p = 0.007) and interleukin 10 
(IL-10) (p = 0.031). Dexamethasone enhanced IL-10 (p = 0.013) and suppressed 
IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, interleukin 6 (IL-6), and interleukin 8 (IL-8) (p = 0.013). 
The two drugs did not suppress: C-reactive protein (CRP), Ig-superfamily 
cell-adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM 1), tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1), 
tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 (TNFR2), or amyloid A. In vitro and in vivo 
evidence is accumulating that TNF-alpha is not the primary cytokine targeted by 
thalidomide in ENL and other inflammatory conditions.

A retrospective analysis of patient's leprosy clinic records at PGIMER, 
Chandigarh, India for the period 1983 to 1998 was undertaken to study the 
frequency, time of onset, and risk factors for leprosy reactions. Of the 2600 
cases analyzed, 1494 were multibacillary and 1106 had paucibacillary disease. 
Presentation with reaction was common with 30.9% of our patients having 
reactions at the time of first visit. The incidence of reversal reaction (RR) 
was highest during 6 to 12 months after starting multi-drug therapy (MDT), 
thereafter declining gradually. Late RR occurred in 9.5% of all cases and was 
noted up to 7 years after treatment. Female gender, widespread disease, and 
multibacillary disease were identified as risk factors for RR. Erythema nodosum 
leprosum (ENL) reactions were noted to occur mostly during second or third year 
after starting MDT. Of the total number of patients who experienced ENL, 64.3% 
had recurrent episodes which continued for up to 8 years after the start of 
treatment. Lepromatous leprosy, female gender, and high Bacterial Index (>/=3) 
were recognized as risk factors for developing ENL. Occurrence of recurrent and 
late reactions, even though of mild severity, highlights the importance of 
recognizing and treating them promptly to prevent or reduce morbidity, 
complications, and further deterioration in the disability status. Although it 
is hoped that leprosy will have been eliminated at all levels by 2005, the 
recognition and management of these reactions will continue to be the most 
essential/significant task in the post elimination era.

There has been a growing interest in lignans, a class of phyto-oestrogens, 
because of their potentially favourable effects on human health. The aim of the 
present study was to compare the metabolic profile of post-menopausal women 
consuming various amounts of dietary lignans. Phyto-oestrogen intake was 
assessed using a 3-d dietary record analysed with a Canadian food 
phyto-oestrogen content data table in 115 post-menopausal women (age 56.8 (SD 
4.4) years and BMI 28.5 (SD 5.9) kg/m(2)). Plasma enterolactone (ENL), the major 
biologically active metabolite of dietary lignans, was determined by 
time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay. Anthropometrics, abdominal adipose tissue areas 
(computed tomography), body composition (hydrostatic weighing) and insulin 
sensitivity (hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp) were measured in all women. 
Women in the high dietary lignan intake subgroup (n 29) had a significantly 
lower BMI and total body fat mass, as well as a better glucose disposal rate 
(GDR; P < 0.05), compared with women in the low lignan intake subgroup (n 28). 
The majority of women with the highest dietary lignan intake were also in the 
highest quartile of plasma ENL (59 %). Women in the highest ENL quartile had a 
significantly lower BMI (26.1 (SD 4.4) v. 30.4 (SD 6.9) kg/m(2), P < 0.05), 
total body fat mass (24.8 (SD 9.8) v. 33.3 (SD 13.3) kg, P < 0.05), 2 h postload 
glycaemia (5.5 (SD 0.9) v. 5.7 (sd 0.8) nmol/l, P < 0.05) and a higher GDR (8.3 
(SD 2.7) v. 5.5 (SD 2.8), P < 0.01) compared with women in the lowest ENL 
quartile. In conclusion, women with the highest ENL concentrations had a better 
metabolic profile including higher insulin sensitivity and lower adiposity 
measures.

In situ characterization of T lymphocyte subsets in the reactional states of 
leprosy.

Modlin RL, Gebhard JF, Taylor CR, Rea TH.

Using monoclonal antibodies and the immunoperoxidase technique, the numbers and 
distribution of T lymphocyte subsets in the tissues of reactional states of 
leprosy (six reversal reaction, nine erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) and two 
Lucio's reaction) were determined and compared with those found in stable, 
non-reactional patients (six tuberculoid, two borderline lepromatous and seven 
lepromatous). The pattern of segregation of the suppressor/cytotoxic phenotype 
at the periphery of the granuloma was found in both non-reactional tuberculoid 
lesions and reversal reactions, but was better developed in the former. In ENL 
and Lucio's reaction, as well as in non-reactional lepromatous tissue, the 
helper/inducer and suppressor/cytotoxic phenotypes were both admixed with the 
aggregated histiocytes. However, the helper/suppressor ratio in ENL (2.1 +/- 
0.4) was significantly larger than that in non-reactional lepromatous tissue 
(0.7 +/- 0.4, P less than 0.001). The immature thymocyte antigen OKT6 was found 
on scattered large non-lymphoid cells, most commonly in tuberculoid and reversal 
reaction tissues, less commonly in ENL, but only irregularly in non-reactional 
lepromatous tissue. The peripheral pattern of the suppressor/cytotoxic phenotype 
may be an immunohistological reflection of a cell-mediated immune response 
common to both non-reactional tuberculoid and reversal reaction patients. The 
reversal of the helper/suppressor ratio in ENL as compared to non-reactional 
lepromatous disease suggests some role for cell-mediated immunity in the 
pathogenesis of ENL. The OKT6 positive cell is of unknown origin and function.

Low serum HDL-cholesterol is associated with raised tumor necrosis factor-alpha 
during ENL reactions.

The concentrations of serum lipids and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) were measured 
in leprosy patients across the spectrum of the disease and in erythema nodosum 
leprosum (ENL) patients at the onset of the reaction and after the reaction had 
clinically subsided. Lepromatous/borderline lepromatous (LL/BL) patients had 
significantly higher serum triglyceride and lower HDL-cholesterol levels; there 
was no such change in the tuberculoid/borderline tuberculoid (TT/BT) patients. 
The household contacts (HC) of the LL/BL patients also had significantly lower 
serum HDL levels. ENL patients during the acute phase of the reaction had 
significantly lower total, LDL-, HDL-cholesterol levels compared to the stable 
LL/BL patients, and these changes were reversible to pre-ENL levels after the 
reaction had subsided. Serum TNF levels were significantly higher in household 
contacts and in LL/BL patients but were not statistically different in TT/BT 
patients. Serum TNF levels were also significantly higher during the acute phase 
of ENL, and declined after the clinical remission of the reaction to levels 
comparable with those of LL/BL patients. There was a significant negative 
correlation between serum TNF and HDL-cholesterol levels during and after ENL 
reaction. However, there was no such correlation between TNF and total or 
LDL-cholesterol levels in ENL patients. Our results suggest that the changes in 
HDL-cholesterol metabolism are a specific part of the host response to 
lepromatous leprosy and to the ENL reaction and may be mediated by increased TNF 
production.

In situ and in vitro characterization of the cellular immune response in 
erythema nodosum leprosum.

Modlin RL, Mehra V, Jordan R, Bloom BR, Rea TH.

We sought to evaluate cell-mediated immune responses in erythema nodosum 
leprosum (ENL), a reactional state occurring in lepromatous leprosy. Skin 
biopsies from patients with leprosy were studied with monoclonal antibodies 
against T lymphocyte antigenic determinants, interleukin 2 (IL 2), and IL 2 
receptors (Tac) by using immunoperoxidase staining of frozen sections. 
Peripheral blood lymphocytes from 18 ENL patients were tested in vitro for 
lepromin-induced suppression of Con A stimulation. Serial studies of seven 
lepromatous patients who developed ENL during the course of the study showed 
increases in both the Leu-3a:Leu-2a ratio and the number of IL 2-positive cells. 
IL 2-positive cells comprised 0.3% of the cells in all of the ENL lesions 
studied as compared with the 0.03% found in nonreactional lepromatous lesions (P 
less than 0.001). Lepromin-induced suppression of the Con A response, present in 
nonreactional lepromatous patients, significantly decreased in patients 
developing the ENL reaction, but returned after recovery from ENL. These changes 
in tissues and peripheral blood suggest that the pathogenesis of ENL is related 
to cell-mediated immune processes. Despite these immunologic changes, however, 
ENL patients do not recover antigen-specific skin tests or eliminate 
Mycobacterium leprae.

Methylation of lysine 79 on histone H3 (H3K79) is mediated by a 
methyltransferase called Dot1-like protein (DOT1L). DOT1L is involved in the 
regulation of telomeric silencing, development, cell cycle checkpoint and 
transcription. However, the mechanisms by which DOT1L controls these unrelated 
and diverse functions are unknown. To gain greater insight into DOT1L-mediated 
functions, we have purified a DOT1L-containing complex using tandem affinity 
purification. Mass spectrometry of the DOT1L-containing complex revealed that 
AF9, ENL and NPM1 were shown to be major DOT1L-interacting proteins. To 
construct a plausible DOT1L-interaction web, AF9-, ENL- and NPM1-containing 
complexes were also purified for mass spectrometry analysis. The data showed 
that DOT1L might control AF9- and ENL-mediated transcription, regulate RNA 
processing, and function as a histone chaperone in a NPM1-dependent manner. In 
addition, the purification of protein complexes identified a number of novel 
interacting partners associated with DOT1L, AF9, ENL and NPM1. These data define 
a unique DOT1L network and shed light on unknown functions of the DOT1L complex.

Suppressor response in lepromatous leprosy patients: role of Leu 2a cells.

del Carmen Sasiain M, de la Barrera S, Ruibal-Ares B, Cardama JE, Gatti JC, de 
Bracco MM.

The contribution of non-specific suppressor mechanisms to the overall 
immunoregulatory defect observed in lepromatous leprosy was evaluated. Con 
A-induced suppression was assayed using the standard two-stage test in 27 
lepromatous leprosy patients, 19 of them during the quiescent stage (LL) and 
eight during erythema nodosum lepromatosum (ENL). Lymphocytes from normal 
individuals react in this assay, yielding higher suppression as the numbers of 
Con A-induced suppressor cells (Leu 2a+ cells) increase. In contrast, two 
patterns of response were observed in both LL and ENL patients: those giving 
lower suppression as the number of suppressor cells increased (LL-A and ENL-A) 
and those responding with the normal pattern (LL-B and ENL-B). The abnormal 
dose-response profile was not related to the disease stage, as both ENL and LL 
patients were included in groups with normal or atypical response. Reaction of 
the potential suppressor cells with anti-Leu 2a antibody abolished suppression 
in LL-B and normals, whereas Con A-induced suppression was unchanged or higher 
in ENL-A, ENL-B and LL-A, indicating that in these patients Leu 2a+ cells 
interfered with the generation of Con A-induced suppression. The contribution of 
spontaneous suppression was examined and it was shown that suppressor activity 
in the absence of Con A stimulus was higher in ENL (both ENL-A and ENL-B) and 
LL-A. Thus, it appears that the occurrence of high spontaneous suppressor 
activity, probably related to in vivo activation, is associated with a relative 
inability to generate de novo suppression after Con A stimulation in these 
patients.

In view of varied reports on the Th1/Th2 paradigm in leprosy, we used a novel 
real time (RT) fluorogenic reverse transcriptase based PCR (RT-PCR) to measure 
cytokine expression in peripheral blood cells from lepromatous leprosy patients 
with stable disease and those suffering from erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL/Type 
II) reactions. To evaluate the role of accessory cells in Th cell 
differentiation, co-expression of Th cytokines interferon gamma (IFNgamma) and 
interleukin (IL) 4 and regulatory cytokines IL 10 and IL 12 was compared in 
antigen stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), cultures 
containing T cells reconstituted with autologous monocytes (MO) and cultures 
containing T cells reconstituted with autologous dendritic cells (DC). 7/8 
stable lepromatous leprosy patients showed co-expression of both IFNgamma and IL 
4, suggesting a Th0 or a combination of Th1 + Th2 subsets in PBMC. The RT-PCR 
demonstrated that stable lepromatous patients and patients in ENL had 
significantly higher levels of IFNgamma mRNA molecules compared to IL 4. In 
fact, 5/8 ENL patients had undetectable levels of IL 4 mRNA, with a skewing of 
the cytokine response towards a Th1-like profile. Consistent with this. IL 12p40 
mRNA molecules were significantly higher in the PBMC of ENL patients compared to 
stable lepromatous patients (P < 0.01). Reconstitution of purified T cells with 
autologous DC and MO from the stable lepromatous group resulted in down 
regulation of IL 4 (P < 0.03 for DC and P < 0.02 for MO) and IL 10 (P < 0. 01 
for DC and P < 0.02 for MO), and a consequent skewing towards a Th1 profile 
similar to that seen in ENL patients. The fact that accessory cells could alter 
the cytokine profile in the reconstituted cultures suggests that they may play a 
role in determining Th subset differentiation in chronic diseases, and may 
influence the immunological stability of such diseases.

Inhibition of de novo IgM antibody synthesis by thalidomide as a relevant 
mechanism of action in leprosy.

Shannon EJ, Miranda RO, Morales MJ, Hastings RC.

Thalidomide is well documented to be an effective treatment for erythema nodosum 
leprosum (ENL) occurring in lepromatous leprosy. To be beneficial, thalidomide 
must interfere with one or more of the several essential steps in the 
pathogenesis of this syndrome, which is presumed to be a clinical manifestation 
of an Arthur-type hypersensitivity. Since complexes of antigen and antibody 
would initiate these events, thalidomide could exert its most direct influence 
on reactants in this essential step. To determine whether thalidomide affected 
de novo antibody synthesis, the effect of the drug on the antibody response to 
sheep erythrocytes in mice was determined. Thalidomide significantly inhibited 
IgM antibody formation when fed to mice for 5 or 7 days before immunization with 
sheep erythrocytes. There was also a selective decrease in serum IgM 
concentrations among leprosy patients being treated with thalidomide for ENL. A 
clinically relevant site of action of thalidomide in ENL appears to be on the 
synthesis of IgM antibody. The target site of the drug among the macrophage, 
antibody-forming, and helper or suppressor lymphocytes remains to be elucidated.

Unusual Presentation of Necrotic Erythema Nodosum Leprosum on Scalp: A Case 
Report.

Barman KD, Madan A, Garg VK, Goel K, Khurana N.

Lepra reactions are acute episodes occurring during the disease process of 
leprosy and are of 2 types: type 1 or reversal reaction and type 2 reaction or 
erythema odosumleprosum (ENL). In the episodes of lepra reaction several parts 
are affected including face and extremities like oral cavity. In the present 
case report we reported a rare case of lepromatous leprosy with necrotic ENL 
involving scalp apart from the usual sites. A 58 year old married male presented 
to us with complaints of spontaneous onset, recurrent eruption of multiple 
reddish raised painful lesions. Biopsy from the infiltrated skin over the back 
showed atrophic epidermis, free Grenz zone, diffuse and periadnexal macrophage 
granulomas with predominant mononuclear infiltrate, appandageal atrophy, 
fibrosis around the neural structures and leukocytoclastic vasculitis. Fites 
stain showed strong positivity for M. leprae. His routine blood investigations 
showed anemia (Hb = 7.8 gm%), neutrophil leukocytosis (TLC = 17,600, DLC = 
P66L28M4E2) and raised ESR (80 mm in the first hour). These bullous and necrotic 
lesions in leprosy may be a manifestation of severe type II reactions in 
patients with very high bacillary load.

Leprosy patients during the natural course of the disease may develop reactional 
episodes, namely reversal reaction (RR) and erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL). 
Immunological events described as occurring during RR indicate up-regulation of 
the immune response, whereas in ENL the events are not fully understood. The aim 
of this study was to analyse the in vivo pattern of cytokine gene expression in 
the reactional states of leprosy. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC, n = 
14) and tissue samples (n = 17) obtained from patients with ENL and RR were 
obtained and assayed by RT-PCR. PBMC obtained from unreactional patients (n = 
15) and normal individuals (n = 5) were also assessed. Expression of interferon 
(IFN)gamma, granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), 
interleukin (IL)-2Rp55, perforin and IL-1beta mRNA in PBMC were detected mostly 
in ENL/RR patients, but not in unreactional patients. Likewise, cytokines such 
as IL-6, IL-8, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)alpha and TNFbeta were also present 
in reactional and tuberculoid patients as opposed to lepromatous leprosy 
(BL/LL). Interestingly, the majority of ENL/RR patients showed messages for 
IL-6, IL-10, IL-12 and TNFalpha in the skin. IFNgamma was detected in 84.6% 
(ENL) and 100% (RR) of the patients, whereas IL-4 was detected only in few 
individuals (38.5 and 25%, respectively). Although mRNA expression and protein 
levels may be different, the data reported in this study suggest a cytokine mRNA 
profile that seems to be indistinguishable for RR and ENL. In addition, it shows 
up-regulation of immuno-inflammatory cytokines in the blood and tissue of the 
same patient examined before and during reaction. Furthermore, it is suggested 
that this pattern of response results from an immunological reactivation that 
might lead to an acute inflammatory response in both reactional episodes.

Although beneficial effects have been attributed to PUFA supplementation in 
high-yielding dairy cows, diets rich in PUFA may also increase oxidative stress 
in tissues such as the liver. To fully exploit the health benefits of PUFA, we 
believe that the addition of natural antioxidants could help in preventing 
oxidative damage. Using an in vitro precision-cut liver slices (PCLS) tissue 
culture system, we investigated the effects of different linoleic acid (LA, 
n-6):α-linolenic acid (ALA, n-3) ratios (LA:ALA ratio of 4, LA:ALA ratio of 15 
and LA:ALA ratio of 25) in the presence or absence of the antioxidant 
enterolactone (ENL) on (1) the mRNA abundance of genes with key roles in hepatic 
lipid metabolism, oxidative stress response and inflammatory processes, (2) 
oxidative damages to lipids and proteins and (3) superoxide dismutase activity 
in early-lactating dairy cows. The addition of LA and ALA to PCLS culture media 
increased oxidative damage to lipids as suggested by higher concentrations of 
thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and increased the expression of nuclear 
factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 target genes. The addition of ENL was 
effective in preventing lipid peroxidation caused by LA and ALA. Transcript 
abundance of sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor 1 and its 
lipogenic target genes acetyl-CoA carboxylase α, fatty acid synthase (FASN) and 
stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) was decreased with LA and ALA, whereas ENL 
decreased FASN and SCD gene expression. Our results show that addition of LA and 
ALA to PCLS culture media lowers hepatic lipogenic gene expression and increases 
oxidative damages to lipids. On the other hand, addition of ENL prevents 
oxidative damages provoked by these PUFA.

The present study was conducted to evaluate whether bodyweight and the 
micronisation of dietary fibre affect the endogenous nitrogen and amino acid 
losses (ENL and EAAL) in pigs. The effect of the micronising process was tested 
by providing pigs with 90 g DM x kg(-1) BW0.75 of a N-free diet supplemented 
with isolated pea inner fibres, presented in native or micronised form and with 
a water-holding capacity of 12 and 4 g water g(-1) DM, respectively. ENL and 
EAAL were measured on pigs weighing 24, 62 and 105 kg. In all cases, daily ENL 
increased linearly (P < 0.05) with BW, for the majority of the AA and total N. 
As BW increased, daily ENL, total EAAL and the majority of EAAL increased 
linearly independently of micronisation (P < 0.05). When expressed per kg DMI, 
total EAAL and the majority of each EAA decreased curvilinearly and reached 
nadir at around 100 kg BW. For ENL expressed per kg DMI, micronisation resulted 
in a curvilinear decrease with increasing BW, as compared to a linear decrease 
for pigs fed the native pea fibre diet (non-micronised). Micronisation of pea 
inner fibres did not decrease ENL or EAAL daily, except for proline. When the 
losses were expressed as g x k(-1)g DMI, micronisation did not decrease ENL but 
decreased (P < 0.05) endogenous losses for a majority of AA as well as for total 
AA. The results suggest that small pigs excrete more endogenous N per kg DMI 
than large pigs and that pea fibre micronisation reduces EAAL but not ENL when 
expressed per kg DMI.

Therapy-related acute myeloid leukemias (t-AML) with translocations of the MLL 
gene are associated with the use of topoisomerase II inhibitors. We established 
the emergence of the malignant clone in a child who developed t-AML with a 
t(11;19) (q23;p13.3) during treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). 
The MLL-ENL and the reciprocal ENL-MLL genomic fusions and their chimeric 
transcripts were characterized from samples collected at the time of t-AML 
diagnosis. We used PCR with patient-specific genomic primers to establish the 
emergence of the MLL-ENL fusion in serially obtained DNA samples. The MLL-ENL 
fusion was not detectable in bone marrow at the time of ALL diagnosis or after 2 
months of chemotherapy (frequency <8.3 x 10(-7) cells(-1)). The genomic fusion 
was first detected in bone marrow after 6 months of treatment at a frequency of 
one in 4,000 mononuclear bone marrow cells; the frequency was one in 70 cells 
after 20 months of therapy. At the first detection of MLL-ENL, the only 
topoisomerase II inhibitors the patient had received were one dose of 
daunorubicin and two doses of etoposide. The MLL-ENL fusion was not detectable 
in blood at the time of ALL diagnosis or after 0.7, 2, 8, 10, and 12 months of 
therapy but was detectable in blood at 16 months (one in 2.3 x 10(4) cells). 
Recombinogenic Alu sequences bracketed the breakpoints in both fusions. These 
data indicate that the malignant clone was not present before therapy, arose 
early during chemotherapy, and was able to proliferate even during exposure to 
antileukemic therapy.

Thalidomide, previously banned owing to the issues of teratogenicity is being 
used and tested for a variety of dermatological and non dermatological 
conditions. The drug has been approved for the management of ENL and Multiple 
myeloma. The drug is commonly known to produce adverse effects like peripheral 
neuropathy and constipation. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is one of the serious 
adverse effects seen with thalidomide use, especially in malignancies and is 
relatively uncommon in non cancer settings like ENL. Here we report a case of 
DVT induced after 8 months of use of thalidomide in a young patient of 22 years 
age suffering from ENL. The case also highlights the problems faced in the 
management of refractory ENL and the treatment of DVT in the setting of multiple 
drug interactions and financial constraints.

Enterolignans are phytoestrogenic compounds derived from the conversion of 
dietary lignans by the intestinal microflora that may be protective against 
cardiovascular diseases and cancer. To evaluate the use of enterolignans as 
biomarkers of dietary lignan intake, we studied the relation between plasma and 
dietary lignans. We determined the dietary intake of 4 lignans 
(secoisolariciresinol (SECO), matairesinol (MAT), pinoresinol, and 
lariciresinol) using the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and 
Nutrition FFQ, and plasma enterodiol (END) and enterolactone (ENL) 
concentrations were determined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass 
spectrometry. The population consisted of 637 men and women, aged 19-75 y, 
participating in a case-control study on colorectal adenomas. Participants did 
not use antibiotics in the preceding calendar year. We found a modest 
association between lignan intake and plasma END (Spearman r = 0.09, P = 0.03) 
and ENL (Spearman r = 0.18, P <0.001). The correlation of total lignan intake 
with plasma enterolignans was slightly stronger than that of only SECO plus MAT. 
The plasma concentrations of both END and ENL were associated with intake of 
dietary fiber and vegetable protein but not with intake of other macronutrients. 
The relation between lignan intake and plasma END was modulated by age and 
previous use of antibiotics, whereas for ENL, it was modulated by weight, 
current smoking, and frequency of defecation. However, even when we included 
these nondietary factors in the regression models, the explained variance in 
plasma END and ENL remained low (2 and 13%, respectively).

Comprehensive evaluation of complement components in the course of type I 
(Lepra) and type II (ENL) reactions.

Delhi, India.

Complement components C1q and C4 of classic pathway; C3d, a breakdown product of 
C3, and factor B of alternate pathway: and C3, a component both of classic and 
alternate pathways, were studied in 35 patients, comprising 18 type I (Lepra) 
and 17 type II (ENL) reactions. There was a significant decrease in C3 and 
factor B with a concomitant rise of C3d during ENL. These changes indicate their 
preeminent role in immunogenesis of type II (ENL) reaction. The changes in the 
classic pathway components, on the other hand, were insignificant, apparently 
suggesting its limited involvement in ENL. Furthermore, reversion of factor B 
and C3d after subsidence of reaction is intriguing and may indicate that they 
are not substantially affected even with contemporary treatment. Complement 
components, of both classic and alternate pathways, showed no significant 
alterations either during type I (Lepra) reaction or after its amelioration.

INTRODUCTION: Thalidomide is an anti- tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a) drug 
used mainly in the management of moderate to severe form of Erythema Nodosum 
Leprosum (ENL). Because of its teratogenic potential it has to be used under 
proper supervision. Our critical analysis tries to look into the rationale with 
which it has been used by means of case reports on lepra reaction.
METHODS: We looked for the case reports between December 2005 to June 2019 in 
databases like Pubmed, Embase and other relevant resources. We used search words 
like "erythema nodosum leprosum(ENL)", "thalidomide", "case report" in different 
combinations to get relevant reports that focus on thalidomide usage atleast 
once at any time point during management. The information extracted were 
indication of thalidomide use, dose, response, outcome, complication if any, 
along with all the demographic details and geographical distribution.
RESULTS: We found 41 case reports eligible for analysis.The information was 
critically evaluated. From the analysis it was found that 7 of the case report 
mentioned the exact indication, 4 case report showed irrational use of 
thalidomide in the case of neuritis without use of steroids, 7 showed proper use 
of Clofazimine prior to thalidomide initiation, 26 case report showed case 
report of rationale dose range and in 4 case reports clofazimine was used prior 
to thalidomide along with the rational dose of thalidomide.
CONCLUSIONS: This analysis helps to guide the rationale use of thalidomide 
focussing on few important points that anyone should keep in mind while managing 
a case of ENL.

A group of 9 Mexican lepromatous leprosy patients was studied at the beginning 
of a type II reaction (erythema nodosum leprosum, ENL) and after 1 or 2 months 
of thalidomide treatment. ENL patients at the onset of the reaction had slightly 
higher amounts of anti-Mycobacterium leprae IgG1 and IgG2 antibodies, compared 
to similar lepromatous patients that did not develop ENL. Neither these antibody 
levels nor IgM and the other IgG subclasses were importantly modified after 
thalidomide treatment. Serum TNF was significantly higher in the patients that 
developed ENL compared to those that did not develop the reaction. TNF levels 
were slightly decreased after 1 month of thalidomide treatment and significantly 
decreased after 2 months of treatment. Serum IFN-gamma was significantly lower 
in patients at the onset of ENL and was increased after 1 and 2 months of 
thalidomide treatment.

postmenopausal women.

Italy.

In this randomized dietary intervention study (DI) we analyzed levels of 
androgens, phytoestrogens, and estrogens in 12-h urine samples of 69 healthy 
postmenopausal women, 37 of whom followed a traditional Mediterranean diet for 6 
months (intervention group) as compared to 32 women who followed their regular 
diet (control group). Circulating levels of both insulin and testosterone (T) 
were also assayed. Overall, enterolactone (ENL) was the most prominent 
phytoestrogen in urines of both control and intervention women, and its levels 
increased by a 20% after DI. At the baseline the ENL levels were seen to be 
significantly associated with both the total androgens (TOT-A) (r= 0.371, P= 
0.002) and the TOT-A/total estrogen (TOT-E) ratio (r= 0.351, P= 0.005) in all 69 
postmenopausal women. Furthermore, the DI resulted in a more pronounced negative 
association of both ENL with insulin (r=-0.321, P= 0.05) and insulin with TOT-A 
(r=-0.421, P= 0.01). Regarding urinary androgens, ENL associated with both 
3alpha-androsterone (5alpha-androgen, r= 0.363, P= 0.002) and 
3alpha-etiocholanolone (5beta-androgen, r= 0.295, P= 0.01) at baseline, while 
after DI, circulating insulin and T exhibited a significant negative association 
with the 5beta-androgen metabolite etiocholanolone (r=-0.487, P= 0.002; and 
r=-0.336, P= 0.042, respectively). We conclude that lignan components of the 
Mediterranean diet, notably ENL, are associated with urinary levels of products 
of androgen metabolism, including both 5alpha- and 5beta-reductase enzymes, in 
healthy postmenopausal women. Further studies are necessary to better understand 
the interplay of sex hormones with dietary phytoestrogens.

Abdominal-type HoxA genes in combination with Meis1 are well-documented 
on-cogenes in various leukemias but it is unclear how they exert their 
transforming function. Here we used a system of conditional transformation by an 
inducible mixed lineage leukemia-eleven-nineteen leukemia (MLL-ENL) oncoprotein 
to overexpress Hoxa9 and Meis1 in primary hematopoietic cells. Arrays identified 
c-Myb and a c-Myb target (Gstm1) among the genes with the strongest response to 
Hoxa9/Meis1. c-Myb overexpression was verified by Northern blot and quantitative 
reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Also MLL-ENL activated 
c-Myb through up-regulation of Hoxa9 and Meis1. Consequently, short-term 
suppression of c-Myb by small inhibitory RNA (siRNA) efficiently inhibited 
transformation by MLL-ENL but did not impair transformation by transcription 
factor E2A-hepatic leukemia factor (E2A-HLF). The anti c-Myb siRNA effect was 
abrogated by coexpression of a c-Myb derivative with a mutated siRNA target 
site. The introduction of a dominant-negative c-Myb mutant had a similar but 
weaker effect on MLL-ENL-mediated transformation. Hematopoietic precursors from 
mice homozygous for a hypo-morphic c-Myb allele were more severely affected and 
could be transformed neither by MLL-ENL nor by E2A-HLF. Ectopic expression of 
c-Myb induced a differentiation block but c-Myb alone was not transforming in a 
replating assay similar to Hoxa9/Meis1. These results suggest that c-Myb is 
essential but not sufficient for Hoxa9/Meis1 mediated transformation.

The SWI/SNF family of chromatin-remodeling complexes has been discovered in many 
species and has been shown to regulate gene expression by assisting 
transcriptional machinery to gain access to their sites in chromatin. Several 
complexes of this family have been reported for humans. In this study, two 
additional complexes are described that belong to the same SWI/SNF family. These 
new complexes contain as many as eight subunits identical to those found in 
other SWI/SNF complexes, and they possess a similar ATP-dependent nucleosome 
disruption activity. But unlike known SWI/SNFs, the new complexes are low in 
abundance and contain an extra subunit conserved between human and yeast SWI/SNF 
complexes. This subunit, ENL, is a homolog of the yeast SWI/SNF subunit, 
ANC1/TFG3. Moreover, ENL is a fusion partner for the gene product of MLL that is 
a common target for chromosomal translocations in human acute leukemia. The 
resultant MLL-ENL fusion protein associates and cooperates with SWI/SNF 
complexes to activate transcription of the promoter of HoxA7, a downstream 
target essential for oncogenic activity of MLL-ENL. Our data suggest that human 
SWI/SNF complexes show considerable heterogeneity, and one or more may be 
involved in the etiology of leukemia by cooperating with MLL fusion proteins.

Erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) is a well-known serious complication affecting 
10% of lepromatous multibacillary leprosy patients. In the chronic form, its 
morbidity may be considerable. Thalidomide and systemic steroids are the two 
current effective drugs for the management of ENL. However, their use in endemic 
countries is often difficult and hazardous, and a search for new therapies is 
needed. We report our experience on the effects of pentoxifylline, a 
methylxanthine derivative, which has recently been suggested as a possible 
effective treatment for ENL attacks.

Leprosy is a chronic infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae. The 
manifestations of this disease varies across the spectrum of tuberculoid (TT) to 
lepromatous (LL) leprosy. The course of this indolent disease is interrupted by 
acute exacerbations in the form of leprare actions. Erythema nodosum leprosum 
(ENL), a type 2 lepra reaction, occurs in lepromatous or borderline lepromatous 
cases, usually in response to multidrug therapy. Early detection and timely 
management of these patients is important to reduce the associated morbidity. We 
report two clinically unusual cases of ENL on fine-needle aspiration cytology. 
In one case, antileprosy treatment was completed 10 years back, whereas in the 
other case, ENL was the presenting feature of the disease. Cytological 
examination of swelling in both the cases showed neutrophils, lymphoid cells, 
clusters of foamy macrophages, histiocytes, and giant cells. Fite stain was 
positive, which confirmed the cytological diagnosis of ENL.

Both epidemiological and experimental evidence is accumulating to show that a 
lignan-rich diet may reduce the risk of human breast cancer. Possible 
anti-cancer effects of dietary lignans on hepatomas or hepatoma cells have not 
been the topic of earlier studies. In the present study, we examined the effect 
of 7-hydroxymatairesinol (HMR) and its mammalian metabolite, enterolactone 
(ENL), on AH109A hepatoma cell proliferation and invasion in vitro. HMR and ENL 
inhibited the proliferation and invasion of AH109A hepatoma cells in vitro. The 
50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of hepatoma cell proliferation was lower for 
ENL (10 microM) than HMR (> 200 microM). Likewise, IC50 of hepatoma cell 
invasion was lower for ENL (9 microM) than HMR (144 microM). ENL suppressed 
hepatoma cell proliferation by accumulating cells in G1 phase and elongating 
doubling time of these cells, and by increasing the rate of apoptosis. 
Subsequently, we investigated in vivo the effect of dietary HMR and ENL on 
growth and metastasis of AH109A hepatomas in rats. Both of these compounds 
reduced the growth and metastasis of solid AH109A hepatomas in rats. These in 
vitro and in vivo findings suggest that HMR has inhibitory activities on tumor 
growth and metastasis in the hepatoma-bearing rats, and that this anti-tumor 
effect is mediated at least partially by ENL, a metabolite of HMR.

In the course of our experiments on the metabolic conversion of lignans to the 
estrogenic substances enterodiol (END) and enterolactone (ENL) by human 
intestinal flora, we isolated two anaerobes, Ruminococcus sp. END-1 and strain 
END-2, capable of oxidizing END. The former selectively converted (-)-END to 
(-)-ENL, while the latter selectively converted (+)-END to (+)-ENL, indicating 
enantioselective oxidation by intestinal bacteria.

BACKGROUND AND AIM: The incidence of extra nodal non Hodgkin lymphoma (ENL) is 
rising throughout the world. However, data regarding ENL as a group is limited. 
The aim was to study the epidemiological and histomorphological trends of 
primary ENL (pENL) in India.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The biopsy materials from sixty eight patients with pENL 
(45 male, 23 female, M:F= 1.9:1), diagnosed over a five year period (2005-2009), 
were analysed and pathologically reclassified according to the World Health 
Organization (WHO) classification, 2008 criteria.
RESULTS: Primary extra nodal non Hodgkin lymphomas constituted 22.0% (68/308) of 
all non Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL). The mean age at presentation for pENL and 
primary nodal NHL was 43 years and 58 years, respectively with a male 
predilection (M: F=2:1). Central nervous system (CNS) constituted the most 
common extranodal site (20/68, 29.5%) followed by gastrointestinal tract (17/68, 
25%), and nose/nasopharynx (8/68, 11.8%). Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL, 
not otherwise specified), extranodal marginal lymphoma of mucosa associated 
lymphoid tissue (MALT) type, and B cell NHL unclassified (U) were the three most 
common histological types observed. T-cell phenotype was rarely noted (4%). 
Follicular lymphomas and anaplastic large cell lymphoma, seen among nodal NHL, 
were absent at extra nodal sites. Majority (41/68, 60%) of the patients with 
pENL were immunocompetent and 55% were in stage I-II with favorable prognosis.
CONCLUSION: Central nervous system was the most common site of ENL, followed by 
gastrointestinal tract. Majority of pENL occurred in immunocompetent hosts with 
a favorable prognosis.

Speckle noise reduction algorithm with total variation regularization in optical 
coherence tomography.

Gong G, Zhang H, Yao M.

Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an important imaging technique extensively 
applied in medical sciences. However, OCT images often suffer from speckle 
noise, which is a kind of multiplicative noise inherited in coherent imaging 
systems. A speckle noise reduction algorithm with total variation (TV) 
regularization is proposed to restore speckled OCT images. It constructs the 
regularization parameter and utilizes the tuning function. The proposed 
algorithm realizes sufficient speckle noise reduction and delicate edge 
preservation. Simulations demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm 
with respect to visual effects, processing time and image quality metrics of 
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), equivalent number of looks (ENL), contrast-to-noise 
ratio (CNR), relative mean square error (RMSE) and edge preservation factor. 
Compared with some classical and typical despeckling algorithms, the proposed 
algorithm exhibits good results in edge preservation, recovery error and time 
efficiency, and presents better SNR, ENL and CNR. The applicability of the 
proposed algorithm with regard to OCT in-device preprocessing is discussed in 
details. Therefore, it promotes the application of OCT imaging in clinical 
diagnosis and analysis.

Being a region endemic for leprosy, clinical practitioners in India often 
encounter myriad manifestations and diverse complications of the disease. 
However, the masking of the obvious clinical presentations due to the 
coexistence of a closely resembling unrelated disorder, a 'mimicker', would 
indeed pose a serious diagnostic predicament unless a high degree of clinical 
suspicion is maintained. Leprosy, also known as Hansen's disease is a chronic 
infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae complex that involves the skin 
and peripheral nerves. Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) also known as von 
Recklinghausen's disease is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder that presents 
with skin changes and benign peripheral nerve sheath tumours called 
neurofibromas. Here, we present the case of a 35-year-old man with NF1 who 
presented with type 2 lepra reaction (erythema nodosum leprosum, ENL) and the 
skin biopsy unmasked ENL nodule among the group of NF1 nodules.

(1)Department of Dermatology, University of Ottawa, Ottawa.

Erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL), or type II reaction, is a common complication 
of lepromatous leprosy that can cause significant patient debility. First-line 
therapy includes prednisone and thalidomide, with clofazimine reserved for 
patients who do not respond to first-line treatment. We present the case of a 
33-year-old woman with ENL that failed to respond adequately to conventional 
therapy over a 6-year period. Because of the severe nature of her disease and 
the adverse effects of therapy that she experienced, a trial of etanercept was 
undertaken, which led to full resolution of her ENL. The rationale behind our 
choice of therapy and its future implications are discussed.

Production of transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta1) by blood monocytes 
from patients with different clinical forms of leprosy.

Goulart IM(1), Mineo JR, Foss NT.

University of São Paulo, Brazil.

In the present study, the concentration of TGF-beta1 secreted by adherent cells 
isolated from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and either 
stimulated with PGL-1 or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or left unstimulated was 
determined by ELISA. The cells were isolated from untreated patients with 
different clinical forms of leprosy and healthy individuals. The adherent cells 
exhibited spontaneous release of TGF-beta1 in all clinical forms of leprosy and 
in healthy individuals; however, lepromatous leprosy/borderline leprosy (LL/BL) 
patients presenting erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) displayed significantly 
higher concentrations of TGF-beta1 than either the other patients studied or the 
controls. These high TGF-beta1 levels were consistently observed when LL/BL ENL 
cells were stimulated with phenolic glycolipid (PGL-1) or LPS, and even in the 
absence of a stimulus (P < 0.01). The most significant differences in TGF-beta1 
levels were observed when comparing the results in the presence of PGL-1 from 
ENL with, in order of significance: tuberculoid leprosy (TT) patients (P < 
0.001), LL/BL patients without ENL (P < 0.01), healthy individuals (P < 0.01) 
and borderline-borderline/borderline-tuberculoid (BB/BT) patients with reversal 
reaction (RR) (P < 0.01). The BB/BT patients produced equivalent levels of 
TGF-beta1 compared with LL/BL patients without ENL, for all types of stimuli (P 
> 0.05). In contrast, TT patients produced the lowest levels of TGF-beta1 among 
all the subjects studied (both patients and healthy controls), especially 
following PGL-1 stimulation (P < 0.001, and P < 0.05, respectively). In 
conjunction with our previous data regarding TGF-beta1 expression in dermal 
lesions, it appears that TGF-beta1 probably plays different roles in leprosy: 
(i) to mediate a suppressive action locally, associated with the presence of 
PGL-1, and (ii) to induce proinflammatory effects when secreted systemically by 
monocytes, thereby acting as a modulatory cytokine in the acute inflammatory 
reactions of ENL and associated with the Th2 immune response in multibacillary 
forms of leprosy.

The crucial clinical problem in leprosy is represented by episodes of intense 
inflammation that produce nerve damage. When Mycobacterium leprae has been 
eliminated by means of antibiotics, the death of the bacteria is not a complete 
solution to the damage caused in nerves. Two of the more frequent 
immunopathological phenomena in Hansen's disease are Type I, reactions, known as 
Reversal Reactions (RR), and Type II reactions, of which the most frequent and 
well known are those called Erythema Nodosum Leprosum (ENL). Type II reactions 
have been defined as an immunologic complication in multibacillary patients. 
Both types of reactions are accompanied mainly by the increase of 
pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha, IL-1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, INF-gamma, 
IL-10, IL-12, among others. In a retrospective analysis of a population of 150 
patients of the Central Service of Dermatology, Institute of Biomedicine, where 
these patients were subjected to Multidrug Therapy (MDT) and MDT + inmunotherapy 
(IMT), both groups presented type II reactions, but the group that additionally 
received inmunotherapy also presented type I reactions. In the group of patients 
that presented ENL, it appeared to be associated with the large amount of 
bacilli in their lesions.

Pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of plant lignan 7-hydroxymatairesinol and 
effects on serum enterolactone and clinical symptoms in postmenopausal women: a 
single-blinded, parallel, dose-comparison study.

OBJECTIVE: 7-Hydroxymaitairesinol (7-HMR) is a naturally occurring plant lignan 
found in whole grains and the Norway spruce (Piciea abies). The purpose of this 
study was to evaluate the bioavailability of a proprietary 7-HMR product 
(HMRlignan, Linnea SA, Locarno, Switzerland) through measurement of lignan 
metabolites and metabolic precursors.
METHODS: A single-blind, parallel, pharmacokinetic and dose-comparison study was 
conducted on 22 postmenopausal females not receiving hormone replacement 
therapy. Subjects were enrolled in either a 36 mg/d (low-dose) or 72 mg/d dose 
(high-dose) regimen for 8 weeks. Primary measured outcomes included plasma 
levels of 7-HMR and enterolactone (ENL), and single-dose pharmacokinetic 
analysis was performed on a subset of subjects in the low-dose group. Safety 
data and adverse event reports were collected as well as data on hot flash 
frequency and severity.
RESULTS: Pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated 7-HMR C max = 757.08 ng/ml at 1 
hour and ENL C max = 4.8 ng/ml at 24 hours. From baseline to week 8, plasma 
7-HMR levels increased by 191% in the low-dose group (p < 0.01) and by 1238% in 
the high-dose group (p < 0.05). Plasma ENL levels consistently increased as much 
as 157% from baseline in the low-dose group and 137% in the high-dose group. 
Additionally, the mean number of weekly hot flashes decreased by 50%, from 
28.0/week to 14.3/week (p < 0.05) in the high-dose group. No significant safety 
issues were identified in this study.
CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate that HMRlignan is quickly absorbed into the 
plasma and is metabolized to ENL in healthy postmenopausal women. Clinically, 
the data demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in hot flash 
frequency. Doses up to 72 mg/d HMRlignan for 8 weeks were safe and well 
tolerated in this population.

Circulating CD4+ CD25 high FoxP3+ T cells vary in different clinical forms of 
leprosy.

BACKGROUND: CD4(+) CD25(high) FoxP3(+) regulatory T cells (T-regs) were reported 
to increase in chronic infections. We aimed at studying their frequency in 
leprosy to investigate their role during Mycobacterium leprae infection.
METHODS: Using flow cytometry, the frequency and FoxP3 expression of circulating 
T-regs was assessed in 38 leprosy patients and 38 healthy controls. Patients 
were divided into; group I tuberculoid (TT), group II borderline cases 
[borderline tuberculoid (BT), borderline (BB), and borderline lepromatous (BL)], 
group III lepromatous (LL), and group IV erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL).
RESULTS: Mean T-regs% and FoxP3 expression were significantly elevated in 
patients (particularly TT) compared to controls (3.8 ± 2.5% vs. 2.5 ± 0.8% and 
78.8 ± 56.2% vs. 55.8 ± 15.7%, respectively) (P < 0.05). Comparing the four 
disease groups, T-regs% was significantly different (median 5.3% in group I, 
3.4% in group II, 2.8% in group III, and 1.2% in group IV; P = 0.005). FoxP3% on 
T-regs was not significantly different between them [median 71.5% in TT, 62.3% 
in borderline categories, 67.75% in LL, and 85.75% in ENL; P = 0.149). Notably 
FoxP3 expression was significantly higher in ENL than controls (P = 0.011).
CONCLUSION: The frequency and suppressive marker of circulating T-regs are 
elevated in TT patients. Patients with LL and ENL express significantly lower 
frequency of T-regs and higher FoxP3 expression (in ENL), consistent with 
disease progression and immune hyper-activation in these disease categories. 
Thus, rather than being detrimental to immunity, intact T-regs activity may be 
beneficial to leprosy patients.

Epidermal keratinocyte Ia expression, Langerhans cell hyperplasia and 
lymphocytic infiltration in skin lesions of leprosy.

Rea TH, Shen JY, Modlin RL.

Epidermal changes, Ia expression on keratinocytes, Langerhans cell hyperplasia 
and lymphocyte infiltration were sought in skin lesions of leprosy: 15 
borderline tuberculoid (BT), six borderline lepromatous (BL), 17 lepromatous 
(LL), 13 erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL), six Lucio reactions and nine reversal 
reactions. All three changes were well developed in BT and reversal reactions. 
ENL showed well developed keratinocyte Ia and Langerhans cell hyperplasia, but 
little lymphocytic infiltration. LL and Lucio tissues had some Langerhans cell 
hyperplasia but little or no keratinocyte Ia or lymphocytic infiltration. BL 
tissues were so diverse as to suggest two distinct subgroups. These findings are 
consistent with the hypothesis that keratinocyte Ia expression is an 
immunohistological sign of a cell-mediated immune (CMI) response. However, the 
Ia keratinocyte expression found in BL and ENL tissues appears contrary to the 
undifferentiated macrophages and numerous bacilli found in the lesions. Thus, if 
a sign of CMI, keratinocyte Ia expression is not a measure of the effectiveness 
of the response.

Enterolactone induces apoptosis and inhibits growth of Colo 201 human colon 
cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo.

570-8506, Japan.

BACKGROUND: The mammalian lignan enterolactone (ENL) is produced from plant 
lignans which are present in large amounts in flaxseed (linseed). The effect of 
ENL on colon cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo, and its mechanisms of 
action, have not been studied in detail.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The growth of the colo 201 human colon cancer cell line 
was examined by colorimetric 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5- 
(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2- (4-sulphophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS) assay, while 
the expression of apoptosis- and proliferation-related proteins (p53, Bax, 
Bcl-xL and S, Bcl-2, Caspase-8, Caspase-3 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen 
(PCNA)) were examined by Western blotting. In vivo tumor growth was examined by 
transplanting colo 201 cells into ENL-treated and placebo-treated athymic mice.
RESULTS: The MTS assay showed that ENL suppressed colo 201 cell growth (IC50 for 
72 h: 118.4 microM) in vitro. On flow cytometry, induction of apoptosis was 
confirmed by the appearance of subG1 populations, while cell cycle progression 
was not affected. The expression of an apoptosis-suppressing protein (Bcl-2) was 
down-regulated, an apoptosis-enhancing protein (cleaved form of Caspase-3) was 
up-regulated, proliferation-related PCNA protein was down-regulated and p53, 
Bax, Bcl-xL and S and Caspase-8 levels were unchanged. ENL, at a dose of 10 
mg/kg given 3 times per week by subcutaneous injection, significantly inhibited 
the growth of colo 201 cells transplanted into athymic mice without any adverse 
effects.
CONCLUSION: ENL suppressed colo 201 human colon cancer cell growth both in vitro 
and in vivo. The tumor-suppressing mechanisms included apoptosis and decreased 
cell proliferation.

During the course of experiments on the transformation of lignans to 
phytoestrogenic substances, such as enterodiol (END) and enterolactone (ENL), a 
previously isolated bacterium, Eubacterium (E.) sp. strain SDG-2, capable of 
phenolic p-dehydroxylation in the biotransformation of secoisolariciresinol 
diglucoside to END and ENL, was concluded to be Eggerthella (Eg.) lenta (Eg. sp. 
SDG-2) on the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. The bacterium could 
transform (+)-dihydroxyenterodiol (DHEND, 3a) to (+)-END (1a), but not for 
(-)-DHEND (3b) to (-)-END (1b) under anaerobic conditions. By incubation of a 
mixture of (+)- and (-)-dihydroxyenterolactone (DHENL, 4a and 4b) with Eg. sp. 
SDG-2, only (-)-DHENL (4b) was converted to (-)-ENL (2b), selectively. On the 
other hand, we isolated a different bacterium, strain ARC-1, capable of 
dehydroxylating (-)-DHEND (3b) to (-)-END (1b) from human feces. Strain ARC-1 
could transform not only (-)-DHEND (3b) to (-)-END (1b), but also (+)-DHENL (4a) 
to (+)-ENL (2b). However, the bacterium could not transform (+)-DHEND (3a) and 
(-)-DHENL (4b). Both bacterial strains demonstrated different enantioselective 
dehydroxylation.

We sought to determine the frequency of primary extranodal lymphoma (ENL) and 
its characteristics in Kanagawa, a human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) 
nonendemic area in Japan. Subjects were 847 newly diagnosed patients with 
malignant lymphoma at the Yokohama City University Hospital and 8 affiliated 
hospitals mainly located in Kanagawa prefecture from 1999 to 2005. We compared 
the clinicopathological characteristics of primary ENL with primary nodal 
lymphoma (NL). Histological specimens were evaluated according to the World 
Health Organization classifications. A total of 395 (46.6%) and 452 (53.4%) 
patients had primary ENL and primary NL, respectively. The frequency of primary 
ENL increased with age. Primary extranodal sites included the gastrointestinal 
tract (30.4%), Waldeyer's ring (17.8%), orbits (7.0%), soft tissue and 
subcutaneous tissue (5.2%), bone (4.6%), skin (4.3%), thyroid gland (4.3%), 
testis and prostate (3.3%), bone marrow (3.3%), nasal and paranasal cavities 
(2.6%), salivary glands (2.3%), lung and pleura (2.0%), breast (1.8%), central 
nervous system (1.0%), uterus and ovary (0.5%), and others (9.8%). Among the 395 
cases of primary ENL, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (61.2%) was most frequently 
diagnosed, followed by extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of 
mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (13.3%) and follicular lymphoma (5.6%). The 
frequency of primary ENL is approximately 50% of the total lymphoma cases in 
Kanagawa, an HTLV-1 nonendemic area in Japan. This frequency appears to be 
higher than that in Western countries.

BACKGROUND: Leprosy can have its course interrupted by type 1 and 2 reactional 
episodes, the last named of erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL). Thalidomide has 
been the medication of choice for the control of ENL episodes since 1965.
OBJECTIVES: These episodes can repeat and cause damages to the patient. In order 
to prevent these episodes, an extra dose of 100 mg/day thalidomide was used 
during six months, followed by a follow-up period of six more months after 
thalidomide discontinuation.
METHODS: We included 42 patients with multibacillary (MB) leprosy who had 
episodes of ENL. They were male and female patients aged between 18 and 84 
years.
RESULTS: Of the 42 patients, 39 (92.85%) had the lepromatous form and three 
(7.15%) had the borderline form. We found that 100% of patients had no 
reactional episode during the use of the drug. During the follow-up period after 
thalidomide discontinuation, 33 (78.57%) patients had no reactional episode and 
nine (21.43%), all of them with the lepromatous form, had mild episodes, which 
were controlled using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory. There were no 
thalidomide-related side effects.
CONCLUSION: A maintenance dose of 100 mg/day of thalidomide showed to be 
effective to prevent repeated type 2 reactional episodes of ENL.

Pentoxifylline decreases in vivo and in vitro tumour necrosis factor-alpha 
(TNF-alpha) production in lepromatous leprosy patients with erythema nodosum 
leprosum (ENL).

Increasing evidence has implicated TNF-alpha as a pivotal molecule involved in 
the systemic inflammatory manifestations of ENL, an acute inflammatory 
complication that may occur in the chronic course of leprosy. In the present 
study, the mechanism of action of pentoxifylline (PTX) as an alternative therapy 
for management of leprosy reactions has been evaluated. The effect of PTX on 
TNF-alpha production was examined in leprosy patients at the protein level and 
at the transcriptional level as well. Treatment of ENL patients with PTX (1200 
mg daily) ameliorated the systemic symptoms and favoured the evolution of 
reactional leprosy lesions. Serum TNF-alpha was assayed before and during 
treatment with PTX in 15 patients. The increased TNF-alpha levels seen in the 
circulation during the reaction were dramatically reduced within 3-7 days of 
therapy. No significant effect on serum IL-6 was noted. In vitro TNF-alpha 
production was assayed upon culture stimulation with Mycobacterium leprae. A 
reduction of inducible TNF-alpha in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) 
was seen after 1-2 weeks of in vivo administration of PTX. Furthermore, no 
effect of the drug on IL-10 secretion was detected in these cultures. A kinetic 
analysis of the expression of TNF-alpha and IL-6 mRNA at the site of leprosy 
lesion was performed in six reactional patients by semiquantitative reverse 
transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The amount of TNF-alpha mRNA 
was increased in the tissue during ENL compared with before the reaction, and 
decreased thereafter following treatment for reaction (either PTX or 
thalidomide). These data suggest that PTX inhibits TNF-alpha production in ENL 
patients both in vivo and in vitro, and it may be useful in the treatment of 
leprosy patients undergoing ENL.

Chromosomal translocations involving 11q23 are frequent in infant acute leukemia 
and give rise to the formation of MLL fusion genes. The mechanism of leukemic 
transformation by these fusions has been the subject of numerous investigations. 
However, the dependence of acute leukemia on MLL fusion activity in vivo and the 
efficacy of targeting this activity to eliminate disease have not been 
established. We have developed a model for conditional expression of MLL-ENL in 
hematopoietic progenitor cells, in which expression of the fusion oncogene is 
turned off by doxycycline. Conditionally immortalized myeloblast cells derived 
from these progenitors were found to induce leukemia in vivo. Leukemic cells 
isolated from primary recipient mice were shown to have acquired additional 
genetic abnormalities and, when transplanted into secondary recipients, induced 
leukemia with shortened latencies. However, the leukemic cells remained 
dependent on MLL-ENL expression in vitro and in vivo, and its ablation resulted 
in regression of established leukemias. This study demonstrates that even 
genetically complex leukemias can be reversed on inactivation of the initiating 
MLL fusion and has important implications for the design of novel leukemia 
therapies.

Identifying pathogen and host-related laboratory parameters are essential for 
the early diagnosis of leprosy reactions. The present study aimed to clarify the 
validity of measuring the profiles of serum cytokines [interleukin (IL)-4, IL-6, 
IL-10, interferon (IFN)-gamma and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha], the 
soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R), soluble T cell (sCD27) and macrophage 
(neopterin) activation markers and Mycobacterium leprae-specific anti-PGL-I IgM 
antibodies in relation to the leprosy spectrum and reactions. Serum samples from 
131 Indonesian leprosy patients (82 non-reactional leprosy patients and 49 
reactional) and 112 healthy controls (HC) from the same endemic region were 
investigated. Forty-four (89.8%) of the reactional patients had erythema nodosum 
leprosum (ENL) while only five (10.2%) had reversal reaction (RR). Follow-up 
serum samples after corticosteroid treatment were also obtained from 17 of the 
patients with ENL and one with RR. A wide variability in cytokine levels was 
observed in the patient groups. However, IFN-gamma and sIL-6R were elevated 
significantly in ENL compared to non-ENL patients. Levels of IFN-gamma, 
TNF-alpha and sIL-6R declined significantly upon corticosteroid treatment of 
ENL. Thus, although the present study suggests limited applicability of serial 
measurement of IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha and sIL-6R in monitoring treatment efficacy 
of ENL, reactions it recommends a search for a wider panel of more 
disease-specific markers in future studies.

Patterns of disease in localized extranodal lymphomas.

Gospodarowicz MK, Sutcliffe SB, Brown TC, Chua T, Bush RS.

The site of origin of lymphoid tissue is an important determinant of lymphocyte 
migration patterns. The association of gastrointestinal (GI) and Waldeyer's ring 
lymphoma and the unique lymphocyte migration pattern of gut-associated lymphoid 
tissue (GALT) have been previously described. To establish whether predictive 
clinical patterns of disease occur in localized Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, survival 
and relapse patterns for 496 patients with stage I and II non-Hodgkin's lymphoma 
(NHL) treated with loco-regional irradiation (XRT) alone were examined. We 
identified 139 patients with GALT lymphoma (defined as arising from primitive 
gut and including Waldeyers' ring, thyroid, and GI lymphomas) and 87 patients 
with extranodal non-gut-associated lymphoma (ENL). Survival and relapse data 
were assessed in multifactorial analysis to correct for previously identified 
other prognostic variables. GALT lymphomas (GALT-L) have a survival advantage 
compared with other ENL (P = .017) independent of stage and histology. A 
difference in distant relapse (DR) rate between GALT-L and other ENL (P = .0002) 
was also identified. The presentation site of localized extranodal NHL is 
predictive of clinical behavior and is an independent determinant of outcome. 
This may be an expression of lymphocytic origin and determinants of migration 
patterns.

Single measurements of enterolactone (ENL) used in epidemiologic studies are 
influenced by intraindividual variation. The objective of this controlled study 
was to investigate short-term intraindividual variations in serum and urine ENL. 
Based on these variations, the number of samples required to describe the basal 
ENL level was estimated. Healthy Danish postmenopausal women (n = 6) aged 54-67 
y completed 3 study periods of 24 h within 2 mo. Blood samples were collected at 
0, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 h and 24-h urine samples were collected. A low-lignan, 
standardized diet of 3 meals was served. ENL was measured by time-resolved 
fluoroimmunoassay. Intraindividual and interindividual variations were estimated 
using a mixed model with repeated measurements. Significant and systematic 
intraindividual within-day variations (CV) of 31% were observed in serum. 
Intraindividual day-to-day variations were 56% and overall intraindividual 
variation of samples collected at random times and on different days was 
estimated to be 64%. Describing this overall variation required 7 blood samples 
when estimated with a precision of 50% and 95% confidence. Day-to-day variations 
in 24-h urine samples were 49%. Large within-day and day-to-day variations 
suggest that a single measurement of ENL is inadequate to estimate the basal ENL 
level.

Wollongong, New South Wales 2522, Australia.

This paper investigates the occurrence and distribution of the lignan 
metabolites enterodiol (END) and enterolactone (ENL) and the isoflavone daidzein 
(DAID) in rat tissues by use of liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization 
mass spectrometry (LC-ESI/MSn) following a variety of dietary regimes. 
Furthermore, we examined the dose-response and distribution of END and ENL in 
liver, testes, prostate, and lung, and we investigated the effects of 
competition between lignans and isoflavones on metabolite distribution. In 
liver, testes, prostate, and lung tissue, dose-related increases in END 
concentration were observed. In the testes, coadministration of 60 mg/kg 
secoisolariciresinol diglycoside (SDG) with 60 mg/kg isoflavones produced 
alterations in the resulting metabolite profile, causing increased END 
concentration and decreased DAID concentration. Results indicate lignan 
accumulation in tissues occurs, and coadministration of lignans with isoflavones 
affects the metabolite profile, with effects dependent on tissue type.

Correlation between TNF production, increase of plasma C-reactive protein level 
and suppression of T lymphocyte response to concanavalin A during erythema 
nodosum leprosum.

The complex symptoms observed in lepromatous leprosy patients with reactive 
episodes of the erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) type are associated with 
different serum components actively participating in the acute inflammatory 
reaction. Among them are the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and the acute-phase 
protein C-reactive protein (CRP). TNF and CRP were found at significantly more 
elevated concentrations in the serum of patients with ENL, with a positive 
correlation of about 95% when compared with patients with nonreactive 
lepromatous leprosy (L) or tuberculoid leprosy (T) or with control individuals. 
Furthermore, in another series of experiments CRP had a specific and significant 
suppressive action on concanavalin A (ConA)-induced lymphoproliferation in 
cultures from patients and controls, the reduction being more marked (75%) in 
patients with ENL. By extrapolation from its known actions, production of TNF 
may have a number of potential consequences for the immunobiology of ENL. Thus, 
TNF may cause direct injury to compromised cells, facilitating mononuclear cell 
activation and production of cytokines such as interleukin-1 and interleukin-6, 
and upregulating hepatocyte expression of CRP. Both CRP and TNF in high serum 
concentrations have the ability to enhance the acute inflammatory process in 
ENL, favoring increased macrophage activation and phagoctyosis, and contributing 
to the elimination of damaged cells and bacilli, as well as in the reduction of 
T-suppressor cells, with a consequent improvement in the immunologic response of 
ENL patients.

[Immunopathology of leprosy].

[Article in Spanish]

Bottasso OA, Morini JC.

Studies including close contacts of leprosy patients were performed; an inverse 
relationship between degree and length of exposure to Mycobacterium leprae (MI) 
and the magnitude of the in vivo specific immune response (Mitsuda reaction) was 
observed. On the other hand, this variable is greatly influenced by genetic 
determination. In the experimental adjuvant arthritis model, MI treatment was 
able to trigger a splenic suppressor cell population with regulatory activity on 
the immune response. These results suggest that the erythema nodosum leprosum 
episode (ENL) is related to an excessive humoral response and immunoregulatory 
alterations.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the urinary nitric oxide metabolites in lepromatous 
patients in ENL (type 2 reactions) and to compare these metabolites after 
subsidence of reactions following antireactional therapy. Further to compare the 
levels in a group of lepromatous leprosy patients without reactions.
DESIGN: The initial urine samples were collected from lepromatous leprosy 
patients when they came with ENL before commencing antireactional therapy and 
repeat samples were taken after resolution of ENL. Morning urine samples were 
collected from LL patients without reactions. Nitrites and nitrates in urine 
were measured using commercially available kit. Mean levels of nitric oxide 
metabolites of LL patients with ENL and without ENL were compared by student's 
't' test. The level during ENL and after resolution was compared by paired 't' 
test.
RESULTS: The nitric oxide metabolites were analyzed in 14 LL patients with ENL 
and after resolution of ENL and in 5 LL patients without reaction. The level of 
urinary nitric oxide metabolite is higher in LL patients in ENL reaction 
compared to LL patients without reaction (P < 0.04). These levels were reduced 
significantly with resolution of reaction following antireactional therapy (P < 
0.004).
CONCLUSION: The findings of this study suggested that the NO/NOM excretion is 
increased in leprosy patients during ENL episodes. With antireactional therapy 
(steroids) and clinical improvement the levels are reduced.

Hypersensitivity reactions called reversal reaction (RR) and erythema nodosum 
leprosum (ENL) occur in leprosy. They are characterized by an increase in tumor 
necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Thalidomide is an effective treatment for ENL 
but not RR. Its effectiveness in ENL is attributed to inhibition of TNF-alpha, 
and this does not explain its failure to treat RR. We assessed thalidomide's 
effect on TNF-alpha in RR. Mononuclear cells from RR and non-RR patients and 
healthy individuals were treated with thalidomide and M.leprae (AFB), a cytosol 
fraction of M. leprae or Dharmendra lepromin. Thalidomide suppressed TNF-alpha, 
but when some RR patients' cells were stimulated with AFB, it enhanced 
TNF-alpha.

Erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) is a common complication of lepromatous leprosy. 
Some patients unresponsive to conventional, first-line therapeutics develop 
recurrent, recalcitrant ENL. Here, we report a case of severe refractory ENL 
that was successfully treated with Etanercept. Biologics may be considered as 
therapeutic alternatives in management of severe, recalcitrant ENL.

We present two infants with KMT2A(MLL)-gene-R-associated BCP-ALL, who received 
HLA haploidentical PBSCT after RIC. The patients developed ALL at age 6 months 
and 3 months, respectively. Case 1 underwent PBSCT at the second CR with 
detectable KMT2A-AFF1(MLL-AF4) fusion gene transcript at 11 months of age, and 
Case 2 at the first CR without KMT2A-MLLT1(MLL-ENL) fusion gene transcript at 
8 months of age. Both patients received G-CSF-mobilized unmanipulated peripheral 
blood mononuclear cells from their HLA haploidentical mothers after 
administration of FLU, MEL, and ATG. Tacrolimus, methotrexate, and mPSL were 
administered as prophylaxis against GVHD. Engraftment was rapidly obtained with 
complete chimerism in both patients. Acute adverse events included acute GVHD in 
Case 1 and bacterial sepsis in Case 2. At last clinical check at age 5 years and 
4 years, respectively, both patients were recurrence-free and attained normal 
growth and development. We conclude that PBSCT from an HLA haploidentical mother 
with non-TBI and non-BU regimen seems feasible and efficacious, offering 
favorable life quality for infants.

TFG/TAF30/ANC1, a component of the yeast SWI/SNF complex that is similar to the 
leukemogenic proteins ENL and AF-9.

California 94305, USA.

The SWI1/ADR6, SWI2/SNF2, SWI3, SNF5, and SNF6 gene products are all required 
for proper transcriptional control of many genes in the yeast Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae. Genetic studies indicated that these gene products might form a 
multiprotein SWI/SNF complex important for chromatin transitions preceding 
transcription from RNA polymerase II promoters. Biochemical studies identified a 
SWI/SNF complex containing these and at least six additional polypeptides. Here 
we show that the 29-kDa component of the SWI/SNF complex is identical to 
TFG3/TAF30/ANC1. Thus, a component of the SWI/SNF complex is also a member of 
the TFIIF and TFIID transcription complexes. TFG3 interacted with the SNF5 
component of the SWI/SNF complex in protein interaction blots. TFG3 is 
significantly similar to ENL and AF-9, two proteins implicated in human acute 
leukemia. These results suggest that ENL and AF-9 proteins interact with the 
SNF5 component of the human SWI/SNF complex and raise the possibility that the 
SWI/SNF complex is involved in acute leukemia.

In this study, we evaluated the activity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells 
(PBMC), isolated from treated and untreated lepromatous leprosy patients, from 
lepromatous leprosy patients during and after reactional episodes (erythema 
nodosum leprosum (ENL) and reversal reaction (RR)), and from normal healthy 
individuals. We determined reactive oxygen intermediate (ROI) production, 
procoagulant activity (PCA) and HLA-DR antigen expression of monocytes, besides 
lymphoproliferation, both in the presence and absence of various stimulatory 
agents. Phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) stimulated ROI production by monocytes 
from all the groups studied, with patients during reactional episodes (ENL and 
RR) showing a significantly higher response (p < 0.009 and p < 0.00001). 
Irradiated Mycobacterium leprae, although having little effect when added alone, 
strongly suppressed PMA-stimulated ROI production. Muramyl dipeptide (MDP) had 
no influence on either basal or on PMA-induced ROI production. Basal monocyte 
PCA, as well as M. leprae or concanavalin A (ConA)-induced monocyte PCA was 
comparable in monocytes from all the groups studied. ConA was able to induce 
mitogenic activity in mononuclear cells isolated from all the groups studied. M. 
leprae, although stimulatory for normal individuals, did not induce 
lymphoproliferation in lepromatous leprosy patients, except for cells from 
patients during RR, which responded equally to M. leprae and to ConA. The 
absence of M. leprae-induced lymphoproliferation in lepromatous leprosy patients 
is not caused by the lack of basal HLA-DR expression, as PBMC from all 
individuals studied showed the same level of this antigen. Our results suggest 
an increase of spontaneous or PMA-induced monocyte activity, as detected by ROI 
production, during the reactional episode; addition of M. leprae suppressed this 
response. The increase in monocyte activity could be correlated with the 
increase of lymphoproliferation response to M. leprae during RR, but not during 
ENL. The importance of a possible immune suppressive action of M. leprae is 
discussed.

Erythema multiforme (EM)-like erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) is a rare atypical 
presentation, and its late appearance after the completion of multidrug therapy 
(MDT) is unusual. We describe the case of a lepromatous leprosy patient who 
after the completion of MDT presented to us with late EM-like ENL and was found 
to be resistant to rifampicin. We discuss the implications of this finding and 
the potential role of resistant bacilli in causing reactions with atypical 
presentations.

leprosy.

To determine whether quantitation of antibodies to mycobacterial carbohydrate 
determinants would be valuable in serodiagnosis and monitoring of leprosy, we 
tested serum IgM antibody to Mycobacterium leprae phenolic glycolipid I and IgM 
and IgG antibodies to Mycobacterium tuberculosis and M. leprae lipoarabinomannan 
(LAM) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Seventy-one percent of patients with 
paucibacillary disease and 85.5% of patients with multibacillary disease were 
positive for at least one of the three antibodies. The 15% of antibody-negative 
patients with multibacillary disease were mostly long-term-treated patients, 
with inactive disease by biopsy. There was excellent agreement between M. 
tuberculosis LAM and M. leprae LAM in detection of antibodies. Bacillary index 
and levels of both IgG and IgM antibodies to LAM were positively correlated when 
all patients were analyzed. When patients with a history of erythema nodosum 
leprosum (ENL) were analyzed separately, there was no correlation between IgM or 
IgG antibody to LAM and bacillary index, a result suggesting a possible role for 
LAM in the pathogenesis of ENL.

The proportion of oligosaccharide chains on the Fc fragment of IgG which 
terminate with N-acetylglucosamine and not galactose (%GO) has previously been 
shown to be raised in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Crohn's disease (CD) and 
tuberculosis (Tb), but to be normal in sarcoidosis (SA), and in both lepromatous 
and tuberculoid leprosy. However we have now studied %GO in sequential serum 
samples collected from lepromatous leprosy patients undergoing episodes of 
erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL). During ENL %GO is transiently raised, and this 
rise parallels an increase in circulating interleukin 2 receptors (IL-2R). These 
findings confirm that changes in T cell function occur during ENL. Moreover it 
appears that %GO rises when there is, simultaneously, T-cell-mediated tissue 
damage and an acute phase response (RA, CD, Tb, ENL), but not when there is an 
acute phase response without major T cell involvement, or chronic T cell 
activity alone (SA, and tuberculoid leprosy). We suggest therefore that %GO is 
an indicator of a type of T cell activity with broad immunopathological 
implications.

Validated proteome profile allows better understanding of disease progression, 
subtype classification, susceptibility patterns, and disease prognosis. Leprosy 
is a spectral disease, with clinically, histologically, immunologically, and 
bacteriologically distinguishable subtypes. In addition, a significant fraction 
of patients undergo immune mediated reactions even after multidrug therapy 
(MDT). Erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) is an immune complex mediated reactional 
condition in leprosy, characterized by a systemic inflammatory condition 
afflicting borderline lepromatous (BL) and lepromatous leprosy patients (LL). In 
this study, we have analyzed serum proteome of leprosy patients undergoing ENL 
reactions and compared it with that of healthy noncontact controls. Depletion of 
albumin and immunoglobulin G (IgG) was optimized using Aurum serum protein mini 
kit (Bio-Rad), and then two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) of these 
serum samples was performed. Differentially expressed proteins were identified 
by MALDI-TOF and MALDI-TOF MS/MS mass spectrometry. Significant increase in one 
of the isoforms of alpha2 chain of haptoglobin was observed in ENL condition. In 
addition, haptoglobin phenotype was determined for healthy controls and leprosy 
patients. Hp 0-0 phenotype was detected in 21.4% of the ENL patients undergoing 
treatment, which on follow up examination showed typable phenotype, thus showing 
a condition of acquired anhaptoglobinemia. Since ENL still remains a threat to 
leprosy disease management, the above findings may provide new insights in 
understanding the development and progression of this inflammatory condition.

Erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) may uncommonly present before treatment in 
patients with multibacillary leprosy. Atypical manifestations are known in ENL 
and may be clinically misleading. Such wide variations in the clinical 
presentation of leprosy in reaction make histopathology an important tool for 
supporting clinical diagnosis. We report bullous ENL presenting as the first 
manifestation of leprosy in a 30-year-old Indian man diagnosed using 
histopathology.

Leprosy is a chronic granulomatous disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae , 
clinically present either as tuberculoid, borderline or lepromatous type. 
Erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) is an acute humoral response in the chronic 
course of lepromatous leprosy. Although very severe ENL reactions are known in 
systemic leprosy, such severity is rare in ocular tissues. A leprosy uveitis 
patient suffered from a severe form of post-therapeutic ENL reaction which 
resulted in perforation of the globe at the site of preexisting subconjunctival 
leproma. Painful blind eye was enucleated. Histopathological study revealed 
infiltration of numerous polymorphs and macrophages packed with acid-fast 
bacilli in the conjunctiva, cornea, ciliary body, ora serrata and sclera. A 
profuse influx of neutrophils on a background of macrophages packed with M. 
leprae confirmed the ocular ENL reaction. This case is reported to alert the 
ophthalmologists to a rare ocular complication of ENL.

Expression of Leukaemia associated transcription factor Af9/Mllt3 in the 
cerebral cortex of the mouse.

Neuroanatomy, Kreuzbergring 36, 37075 Goettingen, Germany. tvogel1@gwdg.de

Mutations of leukaemia associated AF9/MLLT3 are implicated in neurodevelopmental 
diseases such as epilepsia and ataxia. This study shows for the first time, that 
murine Af9 is transcribed in various CNS structures including the subventricular 
zone (SVZ) of the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, cerebellar cortex, septum and 
various thalamic structures, the choroid plexus, and the midbrain/hindbrain 
boundary. Expression of Af9 in the SVZ overlaps with Svet1, Cux2, and partially 
with Tbr2, confining its activity to the neurogenic compartment of the SVZ. In 
contrast to Svet1 and Cux2 expression, Af9 transcription is not limited to upper 
layer neurons but is found in the entire cortical plate. As part of an extensive 
network of interacting proteins involved in epigenetic DNA modification, we 
could show overlapping expression of Af9 with Af4/Aff1 and Fmr2/Aff2, two genes 
that are also related to neurodevelopmental diseases, as well as with the highly 
homologous Enl.

Erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) is an immunological reaction corresponding to 
vascularitis due to circulating immune complexes usually occurring during 
treatment of lepromatous leprosy. The precise mechanism underlying ENL are 
unclear but involvement of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) is suspected. 
Based on this suspicion pentoxifylline has been used instead of conventional 
treatments such as corticosteroids and thalidomide.

Proteolysis leads to the appearance of the long form of beta3-endonexin in human 
platelets.

After vessel injury, platelets adhere to the subendothelial matrix. Platelet 
adhesion leads to activation of the platelet integrin alpha(IIb)beta3, which 
then binds to fibrinogen, leading to platelet aggregation. It has been shown 
that a beta3-integrin binding protein, beta3-endonexin, can activate the 
integrin alpha(IIb)beta3 expressed in transfected CHO cells. Several isoforms of 
beta3-endonexin are known but it is not clear which isoforms are expressed in 
platelets and what role they may play during haemostasis. Here, we show that the 
long form of beta3-endonexin (EN-L) can be detected in platelet lysates several 
hours after thrombus formation, after long-term storage of platelets and after 
glucose deprivation. After subcellular fractionation, EN-L is found in the 
detergent insoluble fraction suggesting that it might be associated with the 
cytoskeleton. EN-L generation is temperature and Ca++ dependent and requires 
physiological salt concentrations. Proteolysis is responsible for the appearance 
of EN-L since a calpain inhibitor prevents its formation and the addition of 
calpain to platelet lysates induces its formation. The appearance of EN-L seems 
to be linked to apoptotic events occurring during long-term storage of platelets 
and, possibly, during late steps of haemostasis after thrombus formation.

MLL chimeric protein activation renders cells vulnerable to chromosomal damage: 
an explanation for the very short latency of infant leukemia.

MLL fusion genes are a predominant feature of acute leukemias in infants and in 
secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) associated with prior chemotherapy with 
topo-II poisons. The former is considered to possibly arise in utero via 
transplacental chemical exposure. A striking feature of these leukemias is their 
malignancy and remarkably brief latencies implying the rapid acquisition of any 
necessary additional mutations. We have suggested that these coupled features 
might be explained if MLL fusion gene encoded proteins rendered cells more 
vulnerable to further DNA damage and mutation in the presence of chronic 
exposure to the agent(s) that induced the MLL fusion itself. We have tested this 
idea by exploiting a hormone regulated MLL-ENL (MLLT1) activation system and 
show that MLL-ENL function in normal murine progenitor cells substantially 
increases the incidence of chromosomal abnormalities in proliferating cells that 
survive exposure to etoposide VP-16. This phenotype is associated with an 
altered pattern of cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis.

Discordance of MLL-rearranged (MLL-R) infant acute lymphoblastic leukemia in 
monozygotic twins with spontaneous clearance of preleukemic clone in unaffected 
twin.

Author information:

Concordance of MLL-rearranged acute leukemia in infant monozygotic twins is 
thought to be 100% with a very short latency period, suggesting that either the 
MLL fusion itself is sufficient to cause leukemia or that it promotes the rapid 
acquisition of additional oncogenic events that result in overt disease. We 
report the first case of discordance in an infant monozygotic twin pair. Twin A 
presented at age 9 months with MLL-ENL(+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia and twin 
B remains healthy 3 years later. The presence and eventual clearance of a clonal 
population of MLL-ENL(+) cells was shown in the bone marrow and peripheral blood 
of twin B. Clearance of this clone was temporally associated with viral-induced 
cytopenias, suggesting an immune-mediated clearance of the clone before the 
development of leukemia. Thus, concordance of MLL-rearranged acute leukemia in 
infant monozygotic twins is not universal. The implications of this case for 
MLL-rearranged leukemogenesis are discussed.

Endonasal laser dacryocystorhinostomy and external dacryocystorhinostomy outcome 
profile in a general ophthalmic service unit: a comparative retrospective study.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the outcome profile of endonasal laser 
dacryocystorhinostomy (ENL-DCR) in comparison with external 
dacryocystorhinostomy (ENL-DCR) carried out as part of general ophthalmic 
service within the same center.
METHODS: Patients who have undergone external or endonasal laser DCR in the 
authors institute with a minimum follow-up of 9 months and at least 3 months 
after removal of the tubes were invited to participate in this research. We used 
a questionnaire and a systematic clinical examination for detecting lacrimal 
passage patency and function. Patients were classified into categories: complete 
anatomical and physiological success; anatomical success with partial relief of 
symptoms; anatomical success with no relief of symptoms; anatomical failure. The 
endoscopic view of the ostium vertical location has been classified into four 
levels.
RESULTS: One hundred and ten external-DCR and 53 Endonasal-DCR procedures were 
evaluated. Free communication (anatomical success) was achieved in 82% 
undergoing Ext-DCR and in 58% undergoing ENL-DCR. A significant number of 
patients continued to have symptoms in spite of a patent fistula (54% for 
Ext-DCR and 39% for ENL-DCR). The site of the opening of the internal ostium was 
significantly related to the persistence of symptoms in spite of free 
communication (P < 0.001, chi-square test).
CONCLUSION: In this series of patients undergoing DCR in a general ophthalmic 
unit, the standard Ext-DCR technique has a higher anatomical success rate than 
the endoscopic laser DCR but not necessarily with equivalent rate of relief of 
symptoms. An inferiorly placed ostium is more likely to result in complete 
relief of symptoms.

Nitrogen utilization in pigs fed diets with soybean and rapeseed products 
leading to different ileal endogenous nitrogen losses.

Nitrogen (N) balance was determined in 36 pigs (BW 24 to 30 kg) fed diets 
inducing different ileal endogenous N losses (ENL). We tested the hypothesis 
that enhanced ENL may be indicative of a higher recycling of endogenous proteins 
that will induce a greater urinary N loss and a lower efficiency of the dietary 
N utilization for retention. The cornstarch-based diets contained either soy 
concentrate (SC), soybean meal (SBM), a mixture of toasted and untoasted soybean 
meal (mSBM), dehulled-toasted rapeseed cake (RC1), non-dehulled-toasted rapeseed 
cake (RC2), or dehulled-untoasted rapeseed cake (RC3). The diets were balanced 
for their content of apparent ileal digestible (ID) CP (108 g/kg feed) and 
apparent ID of Lys, Thr, Met+Cys, Trp, and Ile. Feeding level was 2.7 times ME 
for maintenance per kilogram BWx75 and restricted to 88% of the requirements for 
ID Lys as the first-limiting amino acid. During a 5-d period, urine and feces 
were collected daily in metabolism cages. Compared with the SC diet (low ENL), 
the diets with SBM (medium ENL) and mSBM (high ENL) resulted in a greater (P < 
.05) urinary N excretion. Nitrogen retention tended to be less (P = .08) in pigs 
fed diets that caused greater ENL. The utilization of ID N for retention in pigs 
fed the mSBM diet was lower (P < .05) than for those fed the SC diet. There were 
no differences in urinary N excretion, N retention, and the utilization of ID N 
for retention in pigs fed the rapeseed diets of different fiber contents (hulls 
as the NDF source). We concluded that, at similar intakes of the first-limiting 
ID amino acid, N retention in pigs fed soybeans tended to be reduced by greater 
ENL as induced by antinutritional factors (e.g., trypsin inhibitors). Rapeseed 
hulls, as the predominant fiber source, do not affect N retention and the 
utilization of ID N for retention.

BACKGROUND: Erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL), the type 2 lepra reaction occurring 
in lepromatous or borderline lepromatous leprosy, presents clinically with acute 
manifestations that compel the patient to seek medical attention. Recognition 
and timely management of these patients is critical in order to avoid permanent 
disability. Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) is a simple, effective tool 
that aids in correct diagnosis and management of ENL.
CASE: A 30-year-old woman presented with history of fever, reddening of the 
face, and multiple raised, reddish, painful swellings of the bilateral forearms 
and legs for 7 days. One year previously, she was diagnosed and treated for 
lepromatous leprosy with type 2 reaction. After a thorough clinical examination 
a diagnosis of ENL was made. FNA smears from the forearm swellings showed 
pus-like material with intact and degenerated polymorphonuclear leukocytes and 
many foamy macrophages with strong granular acid-fast bacillus (AFB) positivity. 
A cytologic diagnosis of ENL was given, which was confirmed on histopathologic 
examination of skin biopsy.
CONCLUSION: Cytologic features such as a large number of intact and degenerated 
neutrophils with foamy macrophages and strong granular AFB positivity, in an 
appropriate clinical background, allows a confident diagnosis of ENL.

The influence of thalidomide on the clinical and immunologic manifestation of 
erythema nodosum leprosum.

Immunologic and clinical manifestations of erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) and 
their response to thalidomide therapy were evaluated. Circulating tumor necrosis 
factor-alpha (TNF alpha) levels were assayed in serum obtained from lepromatous 
leprosy patients at diagnosis, during multidrug therapy, at the onset of ENL 
episodes, and during treatment with thalidomide. Patients with systemic ENL 
demonstrated the highest serum TNF alpha levels, which decreased significantly 
during thalidomide treatment. Serum TNF alpha in nonreactional patients was 
associated with mild flu-like symptoms and local inflammatory lesions. Serum 
interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) was also elevated in patients with high TNF alpha 
levels. Thalidomide therapy reduced not only serum TNF alpha levels and the 
clinical symptoms but also the dermal infiltration of polymorphonuclear 
leukocytes and T cells. The expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 and 
major histocompatibility complex class II antigens on the epidermal 
keratinocytes was also down-regulated. These results indicate that the 
thalidomide-induced alleviation of clinical symptoms of ENL was associated with 
a reduction of TNF alpha levels.

A human intestinal bacterium, strain END-2, which enantioselectively oxidizes 
(+)-enterodiol (END) to (+)-enterolactone (ENL) through enterolactol is also 
responsible for demethylation during plant lignan metabolism. A free hydroxyl 
group adjacent to the methoxy group is required for demethylation. The bacterium 
transformed (+)- and (-)-secoisolariciresinol to (+)-ENL and (-)-END, 
respectively, by co-incubation with strain ARC-1, which is responsible for 
dehydroxylation.

Lepromatous leprosy patients may develop necrotic lesions, usually in the 
context of Lucio phenomenon (LP) or severe erythema nodosum (EN). The clinical 
and histopathological characteristics of the necrotic manifestations of both 
entities may eventually be confounded. We describe a patient with lepromatous 
leprosy who developed, since the 4th month of her first pregnancy, recurrent 
necrotic lesions in lower limbs, which, at the postpartum, worsened and led to 
partial destruction of ears and nose. In addition, she referred painful nodes on 
upper limbs since 1 year before pregnancy and intermittent swelling and 
tenderness of the ankles, which together with a right tibial and ulnar neuritis 
led to the diagnosis of, erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL). The histopathology of 
a biopsy of the upper limb (ENL) revealed a dermal-hypodermal inflammation with 
vasculitis and vascular lumen narrowing, whereas biopsy of the lower limb (LP) 
revealed small vessels with fibrin thrombi on the superficial layer of the 
dermis without inflammatory infiltrate and no evidence of vasculitis. Thus, 
besides having several different clinical features, LP and ENL result from 
different pathogenetic mechanisms. The histopathological and clinical features 
distinguishing both entities are proposed. This distinction is important because 
decrease in bacillary load through multidrug therapy is the main target in LP, 
whereas in ENL, concomitant reduction of the reaction by means of thalidomide or 
high-dose steroids is recommended.

Estrogenic plant compounds from the human diet such as the lignan 
secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG, 1) can exert biological activity in the 
human body upon ingestion and bioactivation to enterodiol (END, 5) and 
enterolactone (ENL, 6). Bioavailability of lignans is influenced by the food 
matrix and gut microbial action, of which the latter is subject to a large 
interindividual variation. In this study, the fate of the lignan precursor SDG, 
present in the lignan macromolecule of flax seed ( Linum usitatissimum), was 
determined during an artificial stomach and small intestinal digestion and 
during metabolism by two different enterolignan phenotypes in a TWINSHIME 
environment (TWIN Simulator of the Human Intestinal Microbial Ecosystem). The 
lignan macromolecule acted as a delivery system of SDG in the large intestine. 
SDG was only hydrolyzed into secoisolariciresinol (SECO, 2) through microbial 
action in the ascending colon, after which it was bioactivated into 
enterolignans from the transverse colon onward. Single demethylation was a first 
step in the bioactivation, followed by dehydroxylation. Enterolignan phenotypes 
remained stable throughout the experimental period. The establishment of END and 
ENL production equilibria reflected the subdominance of ENL-producing bacteria 
in the gastrointestinal tract.

Effect of rhuIFN-gamma treatment in multibacillary leprosy patients.

Janeiro, Brazil.

Previous studies have shown that when multibacillary leprosy patients were 
treated with recombinant human interferon gamma (rhuIFN-gamma) for 6-10 months 
there was an accelerated reduction in the number of acid-fast bacilli in the 
skin at the site of injection as well as an accelerated bacillary reduction at 
distal sites. However, this favorable out-come of IFN-gamma treatment was 
associated with the development of erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL). The present 
study was undertaken to investigate whether rhuIFN-gamma-induced bacillary 
clearance could be disassociated from the induction of ENL. rhuIFN-gamma was 
administered together with thalidomide and conventional multidrug chemotherapy 
to newly diagnosed leprosy patients. During treatment with this combination of 
drugs, the mean reduction in bacterial load was the same as the reduction 
observed with chemotherapy alone. Moreover, the inclusion of thalidomide in the 
treatment regimen was associated with a low frequency of ENL episodes. A second 
group of leprosy patients, who had already completed 2 years of chemotherapy, 
were treated with rhuIFN-gamma only. In those patients who were skin bacilli 
negative, ENL did not occur during rhuIFN-gamma treatment. In contrast, in 
bacilli-positive patients the frequency of ENL during rhuIFN-gamma treatment was 
higher, as was the occurrence of local erythema and induration. However, 
rhuIFN-gamma treatment without concomitant chemotherapy did not result in a 
reduction in the bacterial load in the skin of bacilli-positive patients. These 
findings, taken together, indicate that rhuIFN-gamma does not, by itself, 
accelerate bacterial clearance, but requires concomitant chemotherapy to achieve 
the accelerated reduction in bacillary load. Thalidomide reduces the frequency 
of IFN-gamma-induced ENL, but also eliminates the IFN-gamma-induced bacillary 
clearance.

Simultaneous localization of MLL, AF4 and ENL genes in interphase nuclei by 
3D-FISH: MLL translocation revisited.

Cuvier, CP26, 75231 Paris Cedex 05, France. michael.gue@curie.u-psud.fr

BACKGROUND: Haematological cancer is characterised by chromosomal translocation 
(e.g. MLL translocation in acute leukaemia) and two models have been proposed to 
explain the origins of recurrent reciprocal translocation. The first, 
established from pairs of translocated genes (such as BCR and ABL), considers 
the spatial proximity of loci in interphase nuclei (static "contact first" 
model). The second model is based on the dynamics of double strand break ends 
during repair processes (dynamic "breakage first" model). Since the MLL gene 
involved in 11q23 translocation has more than 40 partners, the study of the 
relative positions of the MLL gene with both the most frequent partner gene 
(AF4) and a less frequent partner gene (ENL), should elucidate the MLL 
translocation mechanism.
METHODS: Using triple labeling 3D FISH experiments, we have determined the 
relative positions of MLL, AF4 and ENL genes, in two lymphoblastic and two 
myeloid human cell lines.
RESULTS: In all cell lines, the ENL gene is significantly closer to the MLL gene 
than the AF4 gene (with P value < 0.0001). According to the static "contact 
first" model of the translocation mechanism, a minimal distance between loci 
would indicate a greater probability of the occurrence of t(11;19)(q23;p13.3) 
compared to t(4;11)(q21;q23). However this is in contradiction to the 
epidemiology of 11q23 translocation.
CONCLUSION: The simultaneous multi-probe hybridization in 3D-FISH is a new 
approach in addressing the correlation between spatial proximity and occurrence 
of translocation. Our observations are not consistent with the static "contact 
first" model of translocation. The recently proposed dynamic "breakage first" 
model offers an attractive alternative explanation.

Reactional state in lepromatous leprosy simulating Sweet's syndrome.

Das T, Ghosh S, Kundu AK, Maity A.

Erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) or Type-2 lepra reaction is a manifestation of 
type-III hypersensitivity response, and usually occurs in certain cases of 
lepromatous and borderline lepromatous leprosy. ENL may present as widespread 
crops of erythematous, inflamed nodules and papules. Rare variants of ENL 
mimicking pemphigus or Sweet's syndrome (SS) have been documented. Here, we 
report an unusual case of persistent ENL in a 52-year-old lady, which we could 
diagnose with the help of skin biopsy and histopathological examination.

Medicine, Los Angeles 90033, USA. rea@hsc.usc.edu

Reported herein are 13 borderline lepromatous (BL) or subpolar lepromatous (LLs) 
patients who presented with or developed delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) 
reactions after initiation of antibacterial therapy, but who subsequently 
developed erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL), the DTH to ENL group. During the same 
time, three LLs patients had ENL followed by relapse-associated DTH, a 
significant (p < 0.05) difference in sequence of the two conditions. The DTH to 
ENL group had statistically significant higher biopsy indexes at the time of 
diagnosis of the DTH reaction compared with two DTH control groups, 7 
multibacillary patients presenting with DTH reactions and 15 BL or LLs who 
developed DTH reactions after starting treatment but had no ENL. DTH-associated 
histologic changes were less well developed in the DTH to ENL group than in 
either of the two control groups. In the DTH to ENL group, 77% required 
prednisone in addition to thalidomide to achieve a complete remission in 
contrast to only 10% of 21 ENL clinical controls. In the DTH to ENL group, the 
classical histologic ENL pattern was present in only 31% of these patients, in 
contrast to 88% of 33 ENL histologic controls. In 9 of 9 of the DTH to ENL 
patients studied, after the ENL remitted, Mycobacterium 
leprae-sonicate-stimulated lymphocyte transformation tests gave stimulation 
indexes within the range of our tuberculoid (TT) and borderline tuberculoid (BT) 
patients, in contrast to absent responses in 6 ordinary, longterm-treated 
patients who had had ENL.

Low risk of breast cancer (BC) has been proposed to be associated with high 
intake of lignans. Some plant lignans are converted to mammalian lignans, e.g., 
enterolactone (ENL), suggested to be the biologically active lignan forms. Until 
now, little attention has been paid to the possible biological activities of 
plant lignans, even though some plant lignans are absorbed and present in serum 
and urine. In this study, we have investigated the antitumorigenic and 
endocrine-modulatory activities of different plant lignans in order to clarify 
the structure-activity relationships. 7-Hydroxymatairesinol (HMR) is [corrected] 
converted to ENL, and both HMR and ENL inhibit the growth of 
7,12-dimethylbenz[a]-anthracene (DMBA)-induced mammary cancer. Nortrachelogenin 
(NTG) resembles HMR, but has a hydroxyl group at C-8 instead of C-7 and is not 
converted to ENL. In DMBA-model, NTG showed no inhibition of tumor growth, but 
increased the uterine weight. Furthermore, life-long exposure to NTG increased 
uterine weight in immature females and ventral prostate weight in adult males. 
In contrast, life-long exposure to HMR had no effects on uterine or prostate 
weights at any age. Our results indicate that a difference in the position of 
one hydroxyl group results in distinct biological responses in vivo, as well as 
different lignan metabolite profiles.

Studies on the genotoxicity of the mammalian lignans enterolactone and 
enterodiol and their metabolic precursors at various endpoints in vitro.

The mammalian lignans enterolactone (ENL) and enterodiol (END) are formed by 
intestinal bacteria from the plant lignans matairesinol (MAT) and 
secoisolariciersinol (SEC), respectively, which are ingested with different 
types of food. ENL and END are weak estrogens. According to epidemiological and 
biochemical studies, lignans may act as anticarcinogens, but little is known 
about their genotoxic potential. We have therefore investigated the effects of 
ENL, END, MAT and SEC on cell-free microtubule assembly and at the following 
genetic endpoints in cultured male Chinese hamster V79 cells: disruption of the 
cytoplasmic microtubule complex, induction of mitotic arrest, induction of 
micronuclei and their characterization by CREST staining, and mutagenicity at 
the HPRT gene locus. The lignans were tested at concentrations of 200 microM in 
the cell-free system and 100 microM in cultured cells, which represents the 
limit of solubility in each assay. The established aneuploidogen 
diethylstilbestrol and the clastogen 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide were used as 
positive reference compounds. As none of the four lignans had any activity at 
the endpoints studied, we conclude that ENL, END, MAT and SEC are devoid of 
aneuploidogenic and clastogenic potential under the experimental conditions used 
in this study.

Mouse models of human cancer are a potential preclinical setting for drug 
testing and for development of methods for delivery of macromolecular drugs to 
tumors. We have assessed a mouse model of leukemia caused by Mll-Enl protein 
fusion as a preclinical situation in which myeloid-lineage leukemia results from 
de novo occurrence of chromosomal translocations between Mll and Enl genes. 
Here, we show that the mouse leukemias respond to cytosine arabinoside, a 
frontline treatment for human leukemia. The observations show that the myeloid 
cells are susceptible to the drug and the mice undergo a remission that 
comprises a reduction of the myeloid population of cells and recovery of the 
lymphoid population. This translocator model should therefore prove useful for 
future drug assessments against the recurrent mixed-lineage leukemia-associated 
translocations.

Ecological data suggest a long-term diet high in plant material rich in 
biologically active compounds, such as the lignans, can significantly influence 
the development of prostate cancer over the lifetime of an individual. The 
capacity of a pure mammalian lignan, enterolactone (ENL), to influence the 
proliferation of the LNCaP human prostate cancer cell line was investigated as a 
function of cell density, metabolic activity, expression and secretion of 
prostate specific antigen (PSA), cell cycle profile, and the expression of genes 
involved in development and progression of prostate cancer. Treatment with a 
subcytotoxic concentration of ENL (60 muM for 72 h) was found to reduce: cell 
density (57.5%, SD 7.23, p < 0.001), metabolic activity (55%, SD 0.03, p < 
0.001), secretion of PSA (48.50% SD 4.74, p = 0.05) and induce apoptosis 
(8.33-fold SD 0.04, p = 0.001) compared to untreated cells. Cotreatment with 10 
muM etoposide was found to increase apoptosis by 50.17% (SD 0.02, p < 0.001). 
Additionally, several key genes (e. g. MCMs, survivin and CDKs) were 
beneficially regulated by ENL treatment (p < 0.05). The data suggest that the 
antiproliferative activity of ENL is a consequence of altered expression of cell 
cycle associated genes and provides novel molecular evidence for the 
antiproliferative properties of a pure lignan in prostate cancer.

Elevated immunoglobulin E against recombinant Brugia malayi gamma-glutamyl 
transpeptidase in patients with bancroftian filariasis: association with 
tropical pulmonary eosinophilia or putative immunity.

A major allergen of the lymphatic filarial nematode Brugia malayi, a homologue 
of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (gamma-GT), is involved in the pathology of 
tropical pulmonary eosinophilia (TPE) through its potent allergenicity and the 
induction of antibodies against the host pulmonary epithelium. To investigate 
the immunoglobulin G (IgG) subclass and IgE responses to recombinant B. malayi 
gamma-GT, we analyzed the results obtained from 51 patients with differing 
clinical manifestations of bancroftian filariasis. gamma-GT-specific IgG1, 
rather than IgG4, was the predominant IgG subclass, particularly in patients 
with TPE (geomean, 6,321 ng/ml; range, 78 to 354,867 ng/ml) and was 75 times 
higher than in patients with elephantiasis (CP) (P < 0.003) and 185 times higher 
than in endemic normal individuals (ENL) (P < 0.010). IgG2 responses were low 
and IgG3 was almost absent, with no significant differences among the groups. 
gamma-GT-specific IgG4 responses were significantly elevated in those with 
subclinical microfilaremia (MF) compared to the CP and ENL groups and correlated 
with the presence of circulating filarial antigen (CAg). More significantly, 
gamma-GT-specific IgE antibody levels were strikingly elevated in patients with 
TPE (geomean, 681 ng/ml; range, 61 to 23,841 ng/ml) and in the ENL group 
(geomean, 106 ng/ml; range, 13 to 1,405 ng/ml) whereas the gamma-GT-specific IgE 
level was 44 and 61 times lower in those with MF and CP, respectively (P < 
0.001). Elevated gamma-GT-specific IgE/IgG4 ratios were demonstrated in patients 
with TPE (ratio, 45) and ENL (ratio, 107). Because expression of gamma-GT in 
Brugia infective third-stage larvae (L3) was demonstrated by immunoblot 
analysis, the elevated gamma-GT-specific IgE antibodies appear to be associated 
not only with pulmonary pathology but also with possible resistance to infection 
in lymphatic filariasis.

Alpha-1-antitrypsin in leprosy.

Deshpande SV, Zawar PB, Chawhan RN, Sengupta SR, Mehta MC.

Estimation of Alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT) levels was carried out in 52 patients of 
various types of leprosy. Fifty age and sex matched healthy individuals served 
as controls. The mean level of AAT in controls was 290.12 +/- 59.56 mg/dl. In 
patients of tuberculoid leprosy (TT), borderline tuberculoid leprosy (BT) and 
borderline leprosy (BB), the AAT levels were found to be 284 +/- 47.03, 314.37 
+/- 31.56 and 324.44 +/- 32.05 mg/dl respectively. These were statistically 
insignificantly raised when compared with controls. In borderline lepromatous 
leprosy (BL), lepromatous leprosy without erythema nodosum leprosum (LL without 
ENL) and in LL with ENL there was a statistically significant rise in AAT 
levels. The maximum levels of AAT were observed in patients of LL with ENL (mean 
500.8 +/- 93.44 mg/dl. P less than 0.001).

Author information:
(1)Department of Zoology, Osmania University, Hyderabad.

Serum estimations of immunoglobulins, complement components and their presence 
in circulating immune complexes were carried out in 39 Lepromatous, 44 ENL and 
22 Post ENL leprosy patients. Serum IgG, IgA, IgM, C3 and C4 levels were 
determined by single radial immunodiffusion. Serum immune complexes were 
precipitated with Polyethylene Glycol (PEG) and IgG, IgA, IgM, C3 and C4 were 
estimated by single radial immunodiffusion and expressed as % of precipitation 
of their serum level. Decreased IgG, IgM; increased IgA and C3; and no change in 
C4 levels are observed in ENL than Lepromatous and Post ENL patients. However, a 
gradual insignificant reduction of IgG, IgA, and IgM was found from Lepromatous 
to ENL and Post ENL patients in the PEG-precipitates. Similarly, C3 and C4 was 
found reduced insignificantly in ENL than Lepromatous and Post ENL patients. The 
significance of these estimations in relation to immune status of ENL reactions 
are discussed.

INTRODUCTION: Erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) is a type of lepra reaction 
treated with corticosteroids and thalidomide, but this association increases the 
risk of deep venous thrombosis (DVT).
OBJECTIVE: To report cases of ENL with DVT in the use of 
thalidomide/corticosteroid associated.
METHODOLOGY: The study was conducted between December 2015 and December 2016 at 
the Eduardo de Menezes Hospital (HEM-FHEMIG).
RESULTS: A clinical case series of 16 patients, eight from HEM-FHEMIG and eight 
from the literature. DVT occurred on 4 continents, mainly in adults and men. All 
patients were multibacillary; four people had pulmonary embolism (PE); there 
were 11 unilateral and five bilateral DVT cases; 12 cases were proximal, two 
distal, and two unspecified. Pharmacological thromboprophylaxis was used on two 
individuals. Outcome after DVT, 14 patients improved, one had sequelae, and one 
died.
DISCUSSION: DVT increased in association with thalidomide/corticosteroid in 
multiple myeloma, but this complication is poorly described in ENL. In proximal 
DVT, there was a greater risk of PE and sequelae venous insufficiency. After 
DVT, start anticoagulation. ASA 100mg/day as prophylaxis for DVT in case of this 
drug association in ENL is recommended.
CONCLUSION: The article illustrates the incidence increase of DVT because of the 
thalidomide/corticosteroid combination in ENL. When this association is 
necessary, use ASA 100mg/day as prophylaxis.

Experiences with Thalidomide for Erythema Nodosum Leprosum– a retrospective 
study.

Darlong J, Govindharaj P, Charles DE, Menzies A, Mani S.

BACKGROUND: Thalidomide is well known as a steroid sparing drug in Erythema 
Nodosum leprosum (ENL) reaction in leprosy. There is no guideline as to when it 
should be offered to patients. Documentation of ENL presentation with its 
morbidity before and after with patient profile can be a baseline to develop a 
selection criteria as to when thalidomide should be started to reduce steroid 
related morbidly.
METHOD: Chart and electronic record review was done.
RESULT: 427 ENL patients attended the hospital from 2010 to 2014. 73 patients 
(67 males six females) were treated with thalidomide. 77% (56) patients were in 
the age group of 16–45 yrs. 16% (12) were dependent and 39% (29) were taking 
steroids at presentation. 82% (60) became dependent while on treatment. Ninety 
five percent were chronic or recurrent ENLs and 73% (53) had moderate to severe 
ENLs over 49 median months. Steroid induced morbidities were (Cushingoid 
features 42%, diabetes 21%, infections GI 42%, genitourinary 26%, cataract 23%). 
There was 11% mortality.
CONCLUSION: Further studies are recommended to diagnose steroid dependence early 
to prevent serious adverse effects.

Erythema Necroticans - A Case Report.

Mehta N, Ramachandran R, Srikanth S.

Erythema Nodosum Leprosum (ENL) is characterized by evanescent, erythematous, 
painful raised nodules which fade within 48-72 hours. Necrotic and ulcerative 
forms are rare presentations of severe ENL. A 27 year old male patient presented 
with multiple erythematous nodules on trunk and extremities associated with high 
grade fever, joint pain and pedal edema. Patient developed ulceration of nodules 
associated with pain and burning sensation over another 3 days. Slit smear 
showed clumps of granular bacilli. Biopsy showed superficial dermis showing 
edema with dense focal perivascular infiltrate of lymphocytes, macrophages and 
few scattered neutrophils. Fite-Faraco stain was negative. Patient was diagnosed 
as a case of erythema necroticans and started on oral steroids and thalidomide. 
The histological findings illustrate the need to consider leprosy diagnosis in 
necrotizing vasculitis even when Virchow's cells are not found in the 
infiltrate. Thalidomide is the drug of choice in such cases. This patient showed 
a marked response to the drug with healing of all ulcers within 2 weeks of 
starting thalidomide.

isotope dilution GC/MS with application to flaxseed consumption in healthy 
adults.

Dietary interventions involving foods that are enriched in lignans, such as 
flaxseed, are drawing attention due to their beneficial protective effects in 
various diseases and human conditions. Accurate quantitation of key lignan 
metabolites such as enterodiol (END) and enterolactone (ENL) is necessary in 
order to identify factors that may influence overall bioavailability. Here we 
describe the validation of a novel supported liquid extraction (SLE) method for 
isolation of plasma enterolignans, END and ENL, using (2)H(6)-labeled isotopes 
with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in micro selected ion storage 
(GC/MS-μSIS) mode. Following enzymatic hydrolysis and SLE extraction with 70:30 
diethyl ether:ethyl acetate, enterolignans were rapidly separated within 8min. 
SLE in combination with GC/MS-μSIS gave high recoveries of 96.4% and 96.0% for 
END and ENL. Intra-assay precision ranged from 2.5 to 5.9% for both compounds 
whereas the inter-assay precision was 2.6-6.9%. SLE was also directly compared 
to liquid liquid extraction (LLE). Both techniques offered high precision and 
accuracy, however, SLE consistently enabled successful analyte extractions and 
derivatizations, unlike LLE, which had an ∼4% failure rate. SLE was also tested 
in a study where dietary milled flaxseed supplementation (30g/day for 1month) 
and enterolignan bioavailability was examined in a healthy, human population 
(n=10). Plasma total enterolignan levels significantly increased (P=0.002) at 
4weeks relative to baseline. Average concentrations for END and ENL were 209nM 
and 304nM, respectively.

Rye is an important source of plant lignans in Finland. In the present crossover 
trial we wanted to study the effect of rye bread as part of the usual diet on 
serum and urine enterolactone (ENL) concentrations in healthy volunteers. 
Eighteen men aged 43 (sem 2.0) years and twenty-one women aged 43 (sem 1.6) 
years consumed wholemeal rye bread and white wheat bread in random order for 4 
weeks. The bread periods were separated by a 4 week wash-out period. The breads 
provided at least 20% of the daily energy intake. The mean intakes of rye bread 
were 219 (sem 14.6) and 162 (sem 5.3) g/d and those of wheat bread were 200 (sem 
9.6) and 153 (sem 5.8) g/d for men and women respectively. Blood samples were 
collected from all subjects and three 24 h urine samples were collected from ten 
men and twelve women at the end of both bread periods for the determination of 
serum concentration and urinary excretion of ENL. The mean serum ENL 
concentrations in both men and women at the beginning of baseline period and at 
the end of the rye-bread period remained constant and were significantly higher 
than those at the end of the wheat-bread period. Correspondingly, daily urinary 
ENL excretion increased significantly during the rye-bread period compared with 
the wheat-bread period and was 5- and 10-fold higher in men and women 
respectively in comparison with the amount of plant lignan precursors measured 
in the rye bread. These data indicate the presence of other precursors for ENL 
in rye which are not detected by the current method of measuring plant lignans 
in food. The possible role of fibre in enhancement of the formation of mammalian 
lignans from their plant precursors in the gut also remains to be determined.

High dose prednisolone treatment of leprosy patients undergoing reactions is 
associated with a rapid decrease in urinary nitric oxide metabolites and 
clinical improvement.

Evidence is accumulating that nitric oxide (NO) produced by macrophages has a 
role in the pathogenesis of reactions in leprosy. We followed the urinary levels 
of the metabolites of NO [nitrite (NO2-) and nitrate (NO3-)] and the clinical 
response to prednisolone treatment in leprosy patients (n = 9) admitted to ALERT 
leprosy hospital Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, because of reversal reaction (RR) or 
erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL). In untreated reactional leprosy patients, the 
levels of urinary NO metabolites (1645 +/- 454 microM, n = 9, ENL = 4, RR = 5) 
decreased significantly 2 weeks after high dose prednisolone treatment (1075 +/- 
414 microM, P < 0.05), and remained stable 4 (895 +/- 385 microM, P < 0.02) and 
6 weeks following treatment initiation (1048 +/- 452 microM, P < 0.02). This 
decrease was also present when the reactional patients were subdivided according 
to the type of reaction (ENL, RR) and coincided with a clinical improvement. In 
patients showing a poor clinical response to steroids, no or minor effects on 
the urinary NO metabolite levels were observed. We conclude that there is a 
correlation between the decrease in urinary NO metabolites and a favourable 
clinical response after high dose prednisolone treatment of reactional leprosy 
patients.

Association of amyloidosis with erythema nodosum leprosum reactions and 
recurrent neutrophil leucocytosis in leprosy.

McAdam KP, Anders RF, Smith SR, Russell DA, Price MA.

Rectal biopsy in 190 inpatients at a leprosy hospital in the Highlands of Papua 
New Guinea disclosed 16 patients with secondary amyloidosis. This represented 
20% of the patients who had had polar lepromatous leprosy (L.L.) for more than 2 
years. Patients with amyloidosis characteristically had either a history of 
recurrent attacks of erythema nodosum leprosum (E.NH) reactions or chronic 
trophic ulcers. Levels of the serum component (protein SAA) antigenically 
related to the amyloid fibril protein AA were monitored, at varying intervals 
for three months, in lepromatous patients with E.N.L. reaction. The SAA levels 
rose during E.N.L. reactions in parallel with the neutrophil count. SAA occurred 
with greatest frequency among patients with LH, while most non-lepromatous 
patients with detectable SAA had chronic trophic ulcers. The correlation between 
raised neutrophil count and elevated SAA concentration, observed in this and 
other studies, suggests that neutrophils are associated with the production of 
SAA.

To examine the immunopathogenesis of type 2 erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) 
reactions in leprosy, we studied cellular and soluble immunologic components of 
skin lesions in 57 patients with reactions (19 acute ENL and 38 chronic ENL), 61 
active patients without reactions, and 33 control patients whose leprosy had 
been treated and cured. Cells, IgM antibody to PGL-1 and Tac peptide levels were 
obtained from fluid aspirated from blisters induced by suction directly over 
representative skin lesions. During ENL reactions: a) the lesions in chronic ENL 
showed a decreased number of CD8+ (T-suppressor) cells and increased 
helper/suppressor ratio as compared to those in acute ENL and non-reactional 
leprosy; b) Tac peptide and IgM antibody to PGL-1 levels were elevated in the 
chronic ENL lesions; c) and systemic administration of corticosteroids appeared 
to cause a reduction in the intralesional CD4+ cell population and IgM antibody 
to PGL-1 but did not change CD8+ cell population and the levels of Tac peptide 
in the lesions. The elevated levels of Tac peptide were localized in the skin 
lesions while increased levels of IgM anti-PGL-1 seemed to be filtered from the 
peripheral blood. We conclude that spontaneous lymphocyte activation in situ, 
primarily of decreased CD8+ and relatively increased CD4+ cells, are important 
features of chronic, recurrent ENL reactions and may be an intermittent or 
cyclic phenomenon during the reaction. Understanding the mechanisms of these 
spontaneous changes in immunity in leprosy will enlarge our knowledge of 
reactions and of the underlying determinants of delayed type hypersensitivity 
and cell-mediated immunity in leprosy, which in turn will allow us to realize 
the potential for artificially manipulating these responses as proposed with 
vaccines or immunotherapy.

A young adult man with 4-years history of lepromatous leprosy (received 
irregularly multidrug therapy) presented with two and half years history of 
symptoms suggestive of chronic erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL), initially 
responded to steroids and thalidomide, but later on failed. During the last 
2-months, he developed fever, vomiting, and subsequently altered sensorium. On 
evaluation, he had hepatosplenomegaly, hyponatremia, hyperferritinemia, 
hemophagocytosis in bone marrow aspiration, lobular panniculitis in skin biopsy, 
and multiple parenchymal nodules in chest imaging. Hence diagnosis of ENL with 
hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytic (HLH) syndrome was established and treatment 
with dexamethasone (10 mg/m2) started. During hospitalization, he developed 
sinus bradycardia, QT prolongations, recurrent ventricular tachycardia, and 
moderate systolic dysfunction. The cardiac complications recovered using a 
temporary pacemaker and were presumed to be due to micronodular cardiac 
deposition of ENL. This case iterates that ENL can present with varied 
presentations like asymptomatic lung nodules and storming cardiac complications. 
More importantly leprosy, ENL, and HLH are a continuum of manifestations of the 
same agent-host interactions.

Chromosome translocations involving band 11q23 are associated with human acute 
leukemias. These translocations fuse the ALL-1 gene, homolog of Drosophila 
trithorax and located at chromosome band 11q23, to genes from a variety of 
chromosomes. We cloned and sequenced cDNAs derived from transcripts of the AF-4 
and AF-9 genes involved in the most common chromosome abnormalities, 
t(4:11)(q21:q23) and t(9:11)(p22:q23), respectively. Sequence analysis indicates 
high homology between the AF-9 gene protein product and the protein encoded by 
the ENL gene fused to ALL-1 in (11:19) chromosome translocations. AF-4, AF-9, 
and ENL proteins contain nuclear targeting sequences as well as serine-rich and 
proline-rich regions. Stretches abundant in basic amino acids are also present 
in the three proteins. These results suggest that the different proteins fused 
to ALL-1 polypeptide(s) provide similar functional domains.

This study demonstrated that polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) participate in 
the acute inflammatory response in leprosy as effector cells. Lepromatous 
patients present intense infiltrate of neutrophils in reactional (ENL) lesions. 
Circulating PMN of nonreactional patients, healthy donors, and reactional 
patients were purified and analyzed in vitro. The study confirmed the short 
lifespan of these cells in culture with progressive changes characteristic of 
apoptosis. Apoptosis was greatly accelerated in ENL patients as shown by 
cellular morphology, later confirmed by qualitative and quantitative analysis of 
fragmented DNA. It was observed that neutrophils stimulated with 
lipopolysaccharide, Mycobacterium leprae, and lipoarabinomannan secrete 
interleukin-8 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha). Thalidomide, a drug 
known to inhibit TNF-alpha synthesis on monocytes, also exerted an inhibitory 
effect on TNF-alpha secretion in neutrophils. These data suggest that PMN can 
participate in the regulation of the immune response in leprosy and can 
contribute to the amplification of TNF-alpha production at the site of ENL 
lesion.

The Lsr2 protein of Mycobacterium leprae and its synthetic peptides have been 
shown to elicit lymphoproliferation and gamma interferon (IFN-γ) release by 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients with lepromatous leprosy 
(M. Chaduvula, A. Murtaza, N. Misra, N. P. Narayan, V. Ramesh, H. K. Prasad, R. 
Rani, R. K. Chinnadurai, I. Nath, Infect. Immun. 80:742-752, 2012). PBMCs from 
16 patients with lepromatous leprosy who were undergoing erythema nodosum 
leprosum (ENL) (type 2) and 5 patients with reversal reactions (RR) (type 1) 
were stimulated with M. leprae, recombinant Lsr2, and six end-to-end synthetic 
peptides (A through F) spanning the Lsr2 sequence. During the reaction all 
patients with ENL showed lymphoproliferation (stimulation index, >2) in response 
to peptides A and F, with other peptides eliciting responses in 75 to 88% of the 
subjects. In PBMC cultures, both lymphoproliferation and IFN-γ release for 
peptide E were significantly higher than for peptides B and C and recombinant 
Lsr2 (P < 0.05, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). Five patients with RR also showed 
enhanced lymphoproliferative responses and IFN-γ release in response to Lsr2, M. 
leprae, and peptide E. Six months postreaction, 14 patients with ENL continued 
to exhibit responses to Lsr2 and its peptides, with the highest responses being 
elicited by peptide E. However, 5 subjects showed no lymphoproliferation and had 
reduced IFN-γ release in response to Lsr2 peptides (P < 0.001, Kruskal-Wallis 
test) but responded to recombinant Lsr2. Six patients with ENL had HLA-A*68.01, 
which the STFPEITHI program showed to have high peptide-binding scores of 20 to 
21 for peptides E, B, and C. Eleven patients had HLA-DRB1*1501 and 
HLA-DRB1*1502, which had high binding scores for peptides C and E. Thus, Lsr2 
and its peptides are recognized in leprosy reactions during and well after the 
subsidence of clinical signs.

Pattern of reactions in leprosy: a clinical appraisal.

Sehgal VN, Rege VL, Mascarenhas MF.

The term 'reactions' is applied in the present text, to describe the acute 
episodes, recognized with the different types of leprosy. The incidence of 
reactions was found to be 9.7% of 1053 cases examined. They were seen in all 
types of leprosy, but their frequency and severity was marked in lepromatous and 
borderline cases, and in majority of them, the age ranged from 20-40 years. The 
precipitating factor(s) could not be established in many; in some dapsone was 
incriminated, followed by bacterial infection and malnutrition. The 
exacerbations of the existing lesion(s) either alone or in combination with new 
lesions (E.N.L.) and E.N.L. lesions alone, were the presenting clinical 
features. The constitutional symptoms were observed largely in the types other 
than the tuberculoid. Foot drop and contractures of the fingers were the common 
sequels of the reactions. An attempt has been made to explain their mechanisms 
in the light of the recent literature.

Chemopreventive Role of Euphorbia neriifolia (Linn) and its Isolated Flavonoid 
Against N-Nitrosodiethylamine-induced Renal Histopathological Damage in Male 
Mice.

AIMS: This study is an attempt to evaluate the tissue protective efficacy of 
isolated flavonoid and hydro-ethanolic extract of Euphorbia neriifolia (HEEN) 
leaves against N-nitrosodiethylamine (DENA) induced renal carcinoma.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Carcinogenicity was induced in Albino mice by oral 
administration of DENA (50 mg/kg body weight). The HEEN (150 and 400 mg/kg body 
weight), Butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA; 0.5 and 1%), and Euphorbia neriifolia 
flavonoid (ENF; 50 mg/kg body weight) were evaluated for their possible tissue 
carcinogenesis protective potential.
RESULTS: DENA treated animals showed alterations in normal renal 
histo-architecture, which comprised of necrosis (N) and vacuolization of the 
cells. On the other hand, the mice treated with Euphorbia neriifolia lower (ENL) 
and higher (ENH) dose and ENF before intoxicated with DENA showed that the renal 
cells were normal (Day 31). Whereas, BHA higher (BHAH) and lower (BHAL) dose 
failed to diminish the abnormalities caused by DENA.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the present study Suggested that ENH and ENF showed 
highest renal-protective activity among all the pretreatments. The results could 
also be expressed in the order of ENH > ENF > ENL > BHAH > BHAL.

Analysis of tissue lesions of the major reactional states of leprosy was 
undertaken to study the immune mechanisms underlying regulation of cell-mediated 
immunity and delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) in man. In situ hybridization 
hybridization of reversal reaction biopsy specimens for INF-gamma mRNA 
expression revealed a 10-fold increase in specific mRNA-containing cells over 
that observed in unresponsive lepromatous patients. Expression of huHF serine 
esterase, a marker for T cytotoxic cells, were fourfold increased in reversal 
reaction and tuberculoid lesions above that detected in unresponsive lepromatous 
individuals. Immunohistology of reversal reactions confirmed a selective 
increase of Th and T cytotoxic cells in the cellular immune response. Of 
interest, the microanatomic location of these serine esterase mRNA-containing 
cells was identical to the distribution of CD4+ cells. Analysis of erythema 
nodosum leprosum (ENL) lesions revealed differences in the underlying immune 
processes in comparison with reversal reaction lesions. Although phenotypic Th 
cells predominated in ENL lesions, IFN-gamma and serine esterase gene expression 
were markedly reduced. We suggest that reversal reactions represent a 
hyperimmune DTH response characterized by a selective increase of CD4+ IFN-gamma 
producing cells and T cytotoxic cells, which result in the clearing of bacilli 
and concomitant tissue damage. In contrast, ENL reactions may be viewed as a 
transient diminution of Ts cells and activity leading to a partial and transient 
augmentation in cell-mediated immunity, perhaps sufficient to result in antibody 
and immune complex formation, but insufficient to clear bacilli from lesions.

Immune complexes and complement hypercatabolism in patients with leprosy.

Bjorvatn B, Barnetson RS, Kronvall G, Zubler RH, Lambert PH.

The occurrence of immune complexes in the serum and the level of the C3 
breakdown product C3d in the plasma from patients with leprosy were studied by 
quantitative methods and the results were compared in various forms of the 
disease. These studies were performed on sixty-two samples from twenty-six 
patients. The serum 125I-C1q binding activity was found to be increased by more 
than 2 s.d., as compared to the normal values, in most of the sera from patients 
with erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) (80%) and uncomplicated lepromatous leprosy 
(82%), but also in the sera from patients with tuberculoid leprosy (58%). In 
vitro studies suggested that immune complexes involving mycobacterial antigens 
were present in leprosy sera. An increased C3d level (greater than 2s.d.) was 
also found in most of the plasma from patients with ENL (70%), but rarely in the 
plasma from patients with uncomplicated lepromatous leprosy (18%) and never in 
tuberculoid leprosy patients' plasma. The absence of a significant correlation 
between the 125I-C1q binding activity and the C3d level in leprosy patients may 
suggest that extravascular immune complexes are involved in the complement 
activation occurring in ENL. The quantitation of C3d in plasma may be of some 
practical interest in the early diagnosis of ENL complications of leprosy.

Histopathological Analysis.

Sharma V(1), Janmeda P(1).

Author information:

AIMS: The aim of this study was to examine the impacts of N-nitrosodiethylamine 
(DENA), a potent environment carcinogen on liver tissue of mice which was 
attenuated by isolated flavonoid and hydro-ethanolic extract of Euphorbia 
neriifolia (HEEN) leaves.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Carcinogenicity was induced in albino mice by a single 
oral administration of DENA (50 mg/kg body weight). The HEEN (150 and 400 mg/kg 
body weight), butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA; 0.5 and 1%) and E. neriifolia 
flavonoid (ENF; 50 mg/kg body weight) were estimated to examine the possible 
anti-cancer potential.
RESULTS: DENA exposed animals showed alterations in normal hepatic 
histo-architecture, which comprised of necrosis (N), dilated sinusoids and 
vacuolization of the cells. Mice treated with E. neriifolia lower (ENL) and 
higher (ENH) dose and ENF before intoxicated with DENA showed that the liver 
cells were normal, with very little necrosis (Day 31). On the other hand, BHA 
higher (BHAH) and lower (BHAL) dose failed to diminish the abnormalities caused 
by the DENA.
CONCLUSION: Results of the present study suggests that the ENH and ENF protects 
the hepatic tissue against DENA-induced hepatic carcinoma. The results could 
also be expressed in the order of ENH> ENF> ENL> BHAH> BHAL.

Canadian case report of erythema nodosum leprosum successfully treated with 
prednisone and thalidomide.

BACKGROUND: Erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) is a disease rarely encountered in 
Canada. It is characterized by multiple remissions and recurrences, often 
requires long-term treatment, and can result in debilitating sequelae.
OBJECTIVE: To promote rapid recognition and adequate therapy for ENL.
METHODS: Case report of a 39-year-old man diagnosed with an ENL. The clinical 
and histopathologic features, treatment provided, and response to treatment are 
detailed in this article.
RESULTS: ENL presented itself as painful cutaneous lesions on the face and 
limbs, bilateral paresthesia of the fourth and fifth fingers, and systemic 
symptoms. Prednisone 40 mg daily for a week and then 60 mg daily for another 
week reduced the lesions by 80% and the pain by 50%. Although prednisone 60 mg 
daily was continued for one more week and then stopped, thalidomide was started 
at a dose of 300 mg daily for 4 weeks and then reduced gradually, which led to 
complete resolution.
CONCLUSION: At the 7(1/2)-month follow-up, the patient remained completely 
asymptomatic.

Thalidomide does not perturb CD2, CD4, CD5, CD8, HLA-DR, or HLA-A, B, C 
molecules in vitro on the membranes of cells with immune potential.

State University, Baton Rouge.

Thalidomide dramatically relieves the signs and symptoms of erythema nodosum 
leprosum (ENL). ENL is an acute inflammatory complication of lepromatous 
leprosy. The cause(s) of ENL as well as the mechanism of action of thalidomide 
in arresting ENL are unknowns. It has been suggested that ENL is the consequence 
of a transient activation of a cell-mediated-immune (CMI) response to 
Mycobacterium leprae. To initiate a CMI response, an interaction between 
adhesion and/or signal transducing molecules on T-cells and molecules on antigen 
presenting cells would occur. An alteration, induced by thalidomide, of one or 
more of the molecules on T-cells or antigen presenting cells that are essential 
to maintaining the reactive state of ENL, could explain Thalidomide's ability to 
attenuate ENL. Thalidomide did not modify: (a) adhesion and/or signal 
transducing molecules such as CD2, CD4, CD5 and CD8, or (b) molecules that 
facilitate antigen presentation such as HLA-DR, HLA-A, HLA-B, or HLA-C.

Genetic and molecular analysis of region 88E9;88F2 in Drosophila melanogaster, 
including the ear gene related to human factors involved in lineage-specific 
leukemias.

USA.

We identified and characterized the Drosophila gene ear (ENL/AF9-related), which 
is closely related to mammalian genes that have been implicated in the onset of 
acute lymphoblastic and myelogenous leukemias when their products are fused as 
chimeras with those of human HRX, a homolog of Drosophila trithorax. The ear 
gene product is present in all early embryonic cells, but becomes restricted to 
specific tissues in late embryogenesis. We mapped the ear gene to cytological 
region 88E11-13, near easter, and showed that it is deleted by 
Df(3R)ea(5022rx1), a small, cytologically invisible deletion. Annotation of the 
completed Drosophila genome sequence suggests that this region might contain as 
many as 26 genes, most of which, including ear, are not represented by mutant 
alleles. We carried out a large-scale noncomplementation screen using 
Df(3R)ea(5022rx1) and chemical (EMS) mutagenesis from which we identified seven 
novel multi-allele recessive lethal complementation groups in this region. An 
overlapping deficiency, Df(3R)Po(4), allowed us to map several of these groups 
to either the proximal or the distal regions of Df(3R)ea(5022rx1). One of these 
complementation groups likely corresponds to the ear gene as judged by map 
location, terminal phenotype, and reduction of EAR protein levels.

The use of pentoxifylline in the treatment of type 2 reactional episodes in 
leprosy.

It has been suggested that erythma nodosum leprosum (ENL) is associated with 
enhanced production of TNF-alpha resulting in increased inflammation of the skin 
and nerve function impairment. Thalidomide and steroids are the major drugs used 
in the treatment of ENL, but due to the serious problems associated with their 
use, alternative therapeutic interventions are being considered. In the present 
retrospective study, the authors report their clinical observations on the 
effect of pentoxifylline (PTX) in the treatment of ENL. Parameters, such as the 
clinical involution of reactional lesions, the regression of the inflammatory 
symptoms associated with the lesions, and the impact on the systemic symptoms 
common to ENL were assessed at regular intervals during PTX therapy. It was 
found that PTX therapy led to total elimination of systemic symptoms within the 
first week of treatment. This improvement was maintained until the end of the 
study (60 days of treatment). Moreover, the evolution of nodular lesions showed 
a 100% improvement within the first 14 days of treatment. However, by the 60th 
day, worsening of the lesions was noted in 20% of the cases. The impression is 
that PTX is well tolerated, and it may be used for improving patient's clinical 
condition during ENL reaction. Nevertheless, a randomized, double blind, 
controlled trial to compare the effects of the widely-accepted thalidomide and 
the yet untested pentoxifylline for treatment of type 2 reaction is still 
necessary.

Directed self-assembly (DSA) of block copolymers (BCPs) is an attractive 
advanced patterning technology being considered for future integrated circuit 
manufacturing. By controlling interfacial interactions, self-assembled 
microdomains in thin films of polystyrene-block-poly(methyl methacrylate), 
PS-b-PMMA, can be oriented perpendicular to surfaces to form line/space or hole 
patterns. However, its relatively weak Flory interaction parameter, χ, limits 
its capability to pattern sub-10 nm features. Many BCPs with higher interaction 
parameters are capable of forming smaller features, but these "high-χ" BCPs 
typically have an imbalance in surface energy between the respective blocks that 
make it difficult to achieve the required perpendicular orientation. To address 
this challenge, we devised a polymeric surface active additive mixed into the 
BCP solution, referred to as an embedded neutral layer (ENL), which segregates 
to the top of the BCP film during casting and annealing and balances the surface 
tensions at the top of the thin film. The additive comprises a second BCP with a 
"neutral block" designed to provide matched surface tensions with the respective 
polymers of the main BCP and a "surface anchoring block" with very low surface 
energy that drives the material to the air interface during spin-casting and 
annealing. The surface anchoring block allows the film to be annealed above the 
glass transition temperature of the two materials without intermixing of the two 
components. DSA was also demonstrated with this embedded neutral top layer 
formulation on a chemical patterned template using a single step coat and simple 
thermal annealing. This ENL technology holds promise to enable the use of high-χ 
BCPs in advanced patterning applications.

Critical residues of the Mycobacterium leprae LSR recombinant protein 
discriminate clinical activity in erythema nodosum leprosum reactions.

We reported earlier (S. Singh, N. P. Shanker Narayan, P. J. Jenner, G. Ramu, M. 
J. Colston, H. K. Prasad, and I. Nath, Infect. Immun. 62:86-90, 1994) that 
polyclonal antibodies directed against selective sequences in the Mycobacterium 
leprae recombinant protein designated LSR were present in lepromatous leprosy 
patients undergoing erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) reactions (type 2 
reactions). In this study using peptides with single-residue deletions from 
positions 6 to 24, we define three distinct regions, GVTY, NAA, and RGD, which 
were important for antibody recognition and for the discrimination of clinically 
silent and active ENL reactions. Antibodies against NAA were found only in 
patients undergoing active reactions. This is in contrast to the results for the 
RGD motif, which was recognized in all ENL patients, irrespective of the 
clinical status. Though GVTY was recognized in both groups of patients, its 
recognition was masked by the flanking glutamic acid. These findings point 
towards a specific molecular recognition pattern that emerges when a lepromatous 
leprosy patient undergoes immune perturbations leading to ENL reactions. 
Moreover, the fine specificity of immunological recognition changes during the 
natural evolution of the host-parasite interaction.

Type 1 reaction masquerading clinically as ENL: A Case Report.

Khodke A, Shetty VP.

Attention is drawn to a Type 1 reaction masquerading clinically as ENL. 
Histology showed no evidence of ENL but suggested heightened T-cell activity 
(CMI), a characteristic feature of Type 1 reaction. We present a case of a 29 
year old man diagnosed as lepromatous leprosy with recurrent Type 2 reaction 
treated with thalidomide for 2 years. The patient was referred to our institute 
from a teaching hospital. Skin biopsies were carried out during two separate 
eruptive episodes 2 months apart. Histopathology showed heightened T-cell 
activity, but no evidence of ENL.

It was possible to prove, by means of retrospective histopathological studies of 
51 glass slides of common erythema nodosum (EN) and 39 glass slides of erythema 
nodosum leprosum (ENL), that the histopathological features of the two groups 
differed in several ways. It was found that the most prominent divergent 
findings between these two diseases was the presence of a lepromatous 
granulomatous infiltrate in the ENL; the predominant location of the 
inflammatory infiltrate was derma-hypodermal in ENL and hypodermal in common EN; 
there was a preferential septa attack in common EN and lobular in ENL; foreign 
giant cells occurred only in common EN; the lymphocyte cell infiltration in 
common EN and of neutrophils in ENL and the presence of inflammatory infiltrate 
around nerves in ENL. Our study has proved that the search for M. leprae does 
not have to be made in all cases of EN as there are histological differences in 
the routine histopathological exam between common EN and ENL that can alert to 
the real need for this procedure. This search must be performed when during the 
routine histopathological exam of sections stained by hematoxilin-eosin the ENL 
histopathological characteristics delineated herein are observed.

Ileal apparent protein and amino acid digestibilities and endogenous nitrogen 
losses in pigs fed soybean and rapeseed products.

We investigated the effects of various protein sources on the apparent ileal 
digestibilities (AID) of CP and amino acids (AA) and on the recoveries of ileal 
endogenous nitrogen (N) in pigs. Ileal endogenous N losses (ENL) were measured 
using the 15N-isotope dilution method. Thirteen pigs (BW of 13 to 20 kg) were 
fitted with a post-valve-T-cecal cannula and two indwelling blood catheters. 
They were fed twice daily at a level of 2.6 times ME for maintenance. 
Cornstarch-based diets contained a soy concentrate (SC; 180.5 g/kg), soybean 
meal (SBM; 295 g/kg), or a mixture of toasted and untoasted soybean meal (mSBM; 
330.4 g/kg) in Trial I or three rapeseed cakes, dehulled-toasted (RC1; 395 
g/kg), non-dehulled-toasted (RC2; 458 g/kg), and dehulled-untoasted (RC3; 390 
g/kg) in Trial II. The protein sources provided diets with similar levels of 
apparent ileal digestible CP (108 g/kg as-fed diet) and Lys, Met+Cys, Thr, and 
Trp. The AID of CP was greater (P < .05) for the SC (86.8%) and SBM (82.8%) than 
for the SBM (68.1%) diet. In Trial II, the AID of CP was greater (P < .05) for 
RC1 (76.2%) and RC3 (75.8%) than for the RC2 (69.5%) diet. For all diets, the 
differences in the AID for most of the AA corresponded to the differences in the 
AID of CP. The ENL (g/kg DMI) were greater (P < .05) for the mSBM diet (3.75) 
than for the SC (2.53) and SBM (2.53) diets in Trial I but were similar (P > 
.05; 2.24, 3.03, and 2.89 for RC1, RC2, and RC3, respectively) among diets in 
Trial II. We concluded that AID of CP of the soybean diets were associated with 
endogenous and dietary N losses. For these diets, increased ENL and dietary N 
losses were associated with a higher dietary trypsin inhibitor activity. For the 
rapeseed diets, dehulling increased AID of CP and AA, due to reduced ENL (P = 
.08) and dietary N losses (P < .05). Toasting of dehulled rapeseed cake did not 
affect the AID of CP and AA (P > .05) while reducing the true ileal CP 
digestibility (P < .05).

Cytodiagnosis of erythema nodosum leprosum. A case report.

Sevagram, Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College, Sawangi, Wardha, Maharashtra, India.

BACKGROUND: The application of cytology in leprosy has been restricted to the 
evaluation of morphologic and bacterial indices by slit skin smears to 
facilitate diagnosis of cases according to the Ridley-Jopling scale. Isolated 
reports have now documented the use of fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) in 
the diagnosis of leprosy.
CASE: A 45-year-old male presented with the abrupt onset of multiple nodular 
eruptions all over the body. The clinical diagnosis was Sweet's syndrome. FNAC 
showed numerous neutrophils in a background of foamy macrophages. Special stains 
revealed the presence of a large number of fragmented acid-fast bacilli in the 
smears. A diagnosis of erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) was made on FNAC.
CONCLUSION: The presence of neutrophils in a characteristic milieu of foamy 
macrophages is seen in lesions of ENL. Such a picture should prompt the 
cytologist to use a modified Ziehl-Neelsen stain to demonstrate acid-fast 
bacilli, as ENL can present as an acute episode in patients without a previous 
diagnosis of leprosy.

We established a leukemia cell line derived from therapy-related acute myeloid 
leukemia with the t(11;19) by xenotransplantation into the NOD/SCID mouse with 
IL-2Rgamma(c)-/- (NOG mouse). The cell line, TRL-01, could be serially 
transplanted from mouse to mouse and also grown in an adherence-dependent manner 
on a murine bone marrow stroma cell line, HESS-5. TRL-01 had the same 
immunophenotype as the original leukemia cells: positive for CD13, CD33, CD11a, 
CD18, CD29, CD49d, CD49e, CD54, CD62L, and CD117, and negative for CD3, CD4, 
CD8, CD19, CD34, CD41a, CD41b, CD135, and myeloperoxidase. Translocation 
(11;19)(q23;p13) in both the original sample and TRL-01 generated MLL-ENL 
chimeric transcripts joining exon 6 and exon 4, respectively, which has a novel 
isoform. In cultures of TRL-01, addition of GM-CSF, SCF, and G-CSF and adhesion 
to fibronectin-coated plates promoted transient proliferation and survival, 
although they did not support long-term culture. Subcutaneous injection caused a 
tumor to form only when HESS-5 was coinjected at the same site. These results 
suggest that TRL-01 is a useful cell line for studying not only the 
leukemia-related biology of MLL-ENL but also the intercellular association 
between leukemia and stroma.

Frequency and extent of thickening of the nucleated epidermis in leprosy 
lesions.

California, Los Angeles, California, USA. rea@hsc.usc.edu

Using 28 specimens of clinically normal skin from lepromatous leprosy subjects 
as a standard for comparison, the mean thickness of the nucleated epidermis was 
found to be significantly increased in untreated lesions from 16 borderline 
tuberculoid, 21 erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL), and 14 reversal reaction 
patients, but was unchanged in borderline lepromatous and lepromatous patients. 
Using specimens from 36 untreated lepromatous and borderline lepromatous lesions 
as the standard for comparison with the lesions of reversal reactions or ENL 
which these patients eventually developed, there was a significant thickening of 
the nucleated epidermis in both reactional states. In both comparison groups, 
there was a greater mean increase and a larger frequency of thickening in the 
ENL lesions than in those with reversal reactions. In the borderline tuberculoid 
and reversal reaction lesions the increase can be understood as secondary to the 
presence of gamma interferon or interleukin-2. The increase in thickness in the 
ENL lesions is more difficult to explain, but it is not inconsistent with a role 
for these same two cytokines.

[Some case reports which suggest correlation between biologics and leprosy, 
Mini-symposium on problems on leprosy].

[Article in Japanese]

Ishida Y.

Biologics are relatively new drugs developed through modern monoclonal antibody 
techniques and became more familiar to some disease treatments such as 
Rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, ankylosing spondylitis, ulcerative colitis, 
malignant lymphoma, SLE and lupus nephritis. Some case reports shows development 
of leprosy during/after biolo- gics treatment and success treatment of ENL with 
biologics. Collection of reports was done through web search by using document 
retrieval engine such as Pub-med and ProQuest. 7 cases of development of leprosy 
with biologics and 2 cases of ENL treatment with biologics and they were 
reported in the mini-symposium of Annual academic meeting of Japan Leprosy 
association. The widespread use of biologics reminds us of development of some 
infectious diseases as a side-effect and leprosy might be one of them. Because 
number of the reports was still very limited, we cannot go to further discussion 
at this moment. Accu- mulation of reported cases will lead the detailed 
information about correlation between biologics and leprosy, either on 
effectiveness or on adverse ones.

Exacerbation reactions in hyperactive lepromatous leprosy.

Ridley DS, Ridley MJ.

Exacerbation reactions (ER) are acute reactions occurring locally in histoid or 
other highly active lepromatous lesions with an exceptionally heavy bacterial 
load. Clinically, they are almost silent although they may cause ulceration and 
the release of viable bacilli. Histologically, the influx of polymorph 
neutrophils and coincident macrophage degeneration mimic erythema nodosum 
leprosum (ENL). Later, the signs of increased permeability or necrosis of small 
blood vessels and mast cell degranulation are differential features. The 
predominant immunoglobulin is IgE, and the main complement component is C1q, C3 
being mostly undetectable. The reactions appear to be mediated in part by 
reagins (although eosinophils are not seen). Immune complexes probably form at 
antigen excess. Of equal importance may be the release from highly activated 
macrophages and neutrophils of hydrolases and proteases, which are capable of 
degrading connective tissue and other cell surfaces. This report is based on a 
histopathological and an immunocytological study of 13 exacerbation reactions in 
comparison with nonreacting hyperactive lesions and with ENL. The results 
support the view that the essential feature of histoid lesions is their 
hyperactivity.

IgM and IgG antibodies to phenolic glycolipid I from Mycobacterium leprae in 
leprosy: insight into patient monitoring, erythema nodosum leprosum, and 
bacillary persistence.

Levis WR, Meeker HC, Schuller-Levis G, Sersen E, Schwerer B.

Serum IgM and IgG antibodies against Mycobacterium leprae-derived phenolic 
glycolipid I (PG) were determined in leprosy patients, contacts, and controls by 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Anti-PG IgM levels increased from the 
tuberculoid (TT) to the lepromatous (LL) pole of the disease spectrum. There was 
a positive linear correlation between anti-PG IgM and bacillary index (BI). 
Patients with erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) had lower levels of serum anti-PG 
IgM than non-ENL patients of comparable BI, suggesting that anti-PG IgM is 
involved in the pathogenesis of ENL. Initial observations indicate that high 
anti-PG IgM levels in bacillary-negative patients might reflect bacillary 
persistence. A study of 2 different substrate reagents in the ELISA 
[2,2'-azino-di(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS), 0.1 mM H2O2, serum 
diluted 1:20, and o-phenylenediamine (OPD), 5 mM H2O2, serum diluted 1:300] 
showed generally good correlation in detection of anti-PG IgM. However the OPD 
system detected more paucibacillary disease (BT), while the ABTS system detected 
the significant effect of ENL on the relationship between BI and anti-PG IgM. 
Anti-PG IgM was clearly dominant over anti-PG IgG. However, certain patients, 
including several patients who had upgraded from LL and borderline lepromatous 
leprosy (BL), showed high levels of anti-PG IgG. Since studies have shown that 
LL patients are selectively deficient in cell-mediated immunity, T-cell products 
may be required for the IgM to IgG isotype switch. We conclude that anti-PG IgM 
is useful for monitoring the bacillary load in individual patients and should 
prove useful for leprosy control strategies.

A 30-year old male presented with fever for last 1 year. There were associated 
multiple painful skin eruptions with hyperpigmentation and scaling over whole 
body which had been progressively increasing. He also had anasarca along with 
generalized weakness. He presented to us in shock after an acute episode of 
gastroenteritis. After stabilization, he was evaluated for cause of fever. 
Routine fever workup (for typhoid, syphilis, malaria, filariasis, HIV, scrub 
typhus, leishmaniasis) was negative. CECT chest and abdomen revealed 
hepatosplenomegaly. There was no response to intravenous (IV) antibiotics and 
anti-fungal medications. Slit skin smears revealed 3+ acid fast bacilli (AFB). 
Skin biopsy revealed fragmented acid-fast bacilli with dense collection of 
neutrophils and foamy histiocytes in upper and middle dermis suggestive of 
Erythema Nodosum Leprosum (ENL). A diagnosis of ENL with lepromatous leprosy was 
made and patient started on steroids and thalidomide and subsequently on 
multidrug therapy (MDT). On therapy, patient's symptoms improved, and skin 
lesions resolved. Though Leprosy itself is a well-known common cause of PUO in 
India, its first presentation as ENL is rare and needs good index of suspicion 
and timely management.

Enhanced cell-mediated immune responses in erythema nodosum leprosum reactions 
of leprosy.

Rao TD, Rao PR.

Cell-mediated immune (CMI) responses were measured in 39 lepromatous, 44 
erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL), and 22 post-ENL patients. The leukocyte 
migration inhibition test was used to measure CMI responses to mitogen 
phytohemagglutinin-P (PHA), crossreacting antigen purified protein derivative 
(PPD) of tuberculin, and armadillo-derived whole and sonicate Mycobacterium 
leprae. "Early T" lymphocytes of the peripheral blood were also enumerated using 
the rosetting technique. Significantly enhanced immune responses (lower 
migratory indices) were found to whole M. leprae during ENL. Although responses 
were high with PHA and PPD, they were identical in all of the groups, indicating 
that during ENL reaction M. leprae-specific responses are enhanced. "Early T" 
lymphocytes also showed a significant increase in ENL reactions compared to 
lepromatous patients. However, there was no response to the leprolin skin test 
in ENL patients in contrast to the enhanced in vitro CMI responses.

    Lepr Rev. 2007 Jun;78(2):170.

The pathogenesis of erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) involves both immune complex 
deposition and dysfunction of cell mediated immunity. Tumour necrosis 
factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) plays an important role in its pathogenesis. 
Thalidomide and corticosteroids are the mainstay of treatment for ENL. However, 
there are often severe limitations to their use. We report a case of recurrent 
ENL treated successfully with azathioprine. A 15-year-old unmarried girl with 
lepromatous leprosy had recurrent ENL for 2 years. She was treated with WHO-MB 
MDT and prednisolone in doses of 40-90 mg a day for 2-12 weeks. Her condition 
was inadequately controlled. The patient was therefore treated with thalidomide 
300 mg and prednisolone 40 mg. The symptoms subsided after 5 days and ENL 
lesions healed in 2 weeks. Prednisolone was reduced by 10 mg per week and 
stopped, while thalidomide was reduced to 100 twice daily after 4 weeks. 
Azathioprine 100 mg (2 mg/kg per day) daily orally was added to prevent 
recurrences. Thalidomide was further reduced and stopped after another 4 weeks 
while she continued with azathioprine in the same doses for 8 months. There was 
no recurrence of ENL lesions and no side effects of the therapy. MB-MDT was 
stopped 1 year ago, and she is on follow-up without any relapse. Azathioprine, 
therefore, appears to be an effective and safe drug to prevent recurrences of 
ENL.

A patient of lepromatous leprosy, who received a high dose of clofazimine as 
part of multidrug therapy, for chronic erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) had 
frequent 'haemoptysis'. The haemoptysis was later found to be due to 
expectoration of clofazimine. This interesting, and perhaps first case of such 
an occurrence, is reported.

Alterations in serum lipids in lepromatous leprosy patients with and without ENL 
reactions and their relationship to acute phase proteins.

Memon RA(1), Hussain R, Raynes JG, Lateff A, Chiang TJ.

(1)Department of Physiology, Aga Khan University, Karachi, Pakistan.

The concentrations of serum lipids were measured in patients with lepromatous 
(LL/BL) leprosy and erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL). The relationships between 
serum lipid levels and serum amyloid A (SAA) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were 
also examined in these patients. LL/BL patients had significantly higher serum 
triglyceride and lower HDL-cholesterol concentrations compared to the endemic 
controls. ENL patients had significantly lower total, HDL- and LDL-cholesterol 
levels compared to the endemic controls. The levels of all lipid metabolites 
also were significantly lower in ENL patients compared to LL/BL patients. The 
concentrations of SAA and CRP were markedly elevated in ENL patients but were 
not statistically different in LL/BL patients compared to control subjects. 
There was a significant negative correlation between SAA and HDL-cholesterol 
levels in both stable lepromatous and reactional (ENL) patients; there was no 
statistically significant correlation between CRP and HDL-cholesterol levels. 
SAA levels also had a significant negative correlation with total and 
LDL-cholesterol levels. Our results indicate that serum lipids are significantly 
altered in patients with lepromatous disease and ENL reaction. Our results also 
suggest that an increase in SAA levels may divert the metabolism of lipoproteins 
from hepatocytes toward macrophages, resulting in a decrease in serum 
lipoprotein levels.

Hepatic structure and function in Papua New Guineans with leprosy.

Cook GC, Corachan M.

Hepatic function, including plasma bromsulphthalein (BSP) clearance was studied 
in 20 Papua New Guineans with leprosy: 11 lepromatous (LL) (6 had erythema 
nodosum leprosum (ENL)) (group A), and 9 tuberculoid or borderline (BT or BB) 
(group B); 12 controls (group C) were also studied. Four of five with abnormal 
BSP results had significant complicating or additional factors (hepatic 
amyloidosis, pustular ENL, hepato-cellular carcinoma and a pyogenic abscess), 
compared with two of 15 with normal results (tuberculous osteitis and pyogenic 
osteomyelitis). In nine (five from group A, and four from group B) needle liver 
biopsy histology was assessed: foci of vacuolated phagocytes and histiocytes, 
and tuberculoid granulomata were the most frequent lesions; none had cirrhosis. 
Leprosy is not associated with impaired hepatocellular function unless a severe 
complication or coincident disease is concurrently present. In this limited 
study therapeutic agents were not associated with abnormal liver structure or 
function. When liver function is abnormal in leprosy, another cause (e.g. 
secondary amyloidosis, sepsis or malignancy) should be searched for.

Erythema nodosum leprosum as the presenting feature in multibacillary leprosy.

Prabhu S, Shenoi SD, Pai SB, Sripathi H.

Leprosy is an ancient disease that has survived into the modern ages despite an 
intense effort to eliminate it worldwide. Here we report a case of a 32-year-old 
woman who had recurrent painful nodules of six months duration. Because of a 
lack of lesions suggestive of leprosy, she was initially diagnosed to have 
cutaneous vasculitis and erythema nodosum. However, because of the persistent 
nature of her condition she was later detected to have leprosy and erythema 
nodosum leprosum (ENL) with the aid of simple diagnostic tests.

Clofazimine in lepra (ENL) reaction, one year clinical trial.

Burte NP, Chandorkar AG, Muley MP, Balsara JJ, Bulakh PM.

Twenty patients of lepromatous leprosy with lepra reaction and suspected dapsone 
resistance were treated with tapering doses of clofazimine. Clinical assessment 
was carried out every week. Bacteriological examination was carried out every 
six month. Fifteen patients became reaction free at the end of three months and 
severity and frequency of reactions was reduced in other patients. Nerve 
tenderness, arthralgia, nodular eruptions and all other signs and symptoms 
except anaesthesia showed complete recovery in fifteen patients and severity of 
the reactions was reduced in others. Gynaecomastia regressed in two out of three 
patients within nine months. In a majority of patients, the BI and MI was 
reduced at the end of 3 months, and further reduced after 6 months, and in one 
case both BI and MI became negative. Clinical and bacteriological improvement is 
attributed to the antibacterial effect of clofazimine while reduction in 
incidence of (ENL) reactions was attributed to anti-inflammatory effect of 
clofazimine. Regression of gynaecomastia may be due to either improvement of 
involvement of testes or liver or both. Apart from dyschromia clofazimine did 
not produce any severe side effects or toxicity.

Erythema nodosum leprosum mimicking Sweet's syndrome: an uncommon presentation.

Mahajan VK, Abhinav C, Mehta KS, Chauhan PS.

Erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) lesions may uncommonly develop ulceration, 
necrosis, pustulation or bullae. This 60 year-old female was hospitalised with 
previously undiagnosed multibacillary (BL) leprosy and Sweet's syndrome-like 
ENL, a presentation that is rarely reported. In addition to skin lesions 
simulating Sweet's syndrome, she had anaemia, elevated ESR, and a peripheral 
leucocytosis with neutrophilia, the laboratory features of Sweet's syndrome. The 
final diagnosis was made from chronic iridocyclitis, presence of lepra bacilli 
in slit-skin smears, and histology. The pathogenesis of Sweet's-like ENL remains 
conjectural. In Sweet's syndrome a complex interplay of various cytokines 
leading to an abundance of pro- inflammatory cytokines in the target tissues has 
been postulated to initiate an abnormal tissue response to certain antigens; 
such findings may eventually explain these uncommon lepra reactions as well.

T cell-monocyte contact enhances tumor necrosis factor-alpha production in 
response to Mycobacterium leprae.

Sampaio EP(1), Oliveira RB, Warwick-Davies J, Neto RB, Griffin GE, Shattock RJ.

Author information:
(1)Leprosy Laboratory, Oswaldo Cruz Institute (FIOCRUZ), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha has been implicated as a key factor in 
inflammatory processes occurring in erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL). In the 
present study, the roles of soluble factors and contact-mediated interaction in 
the induction of enhanced TNF-alpha secretion in leprosy have been investigated. 
In vitro studies have demonstrated that Mycobacterium leprae per se is a poor 
stimulus for TNF-alpha production by purified monocytes obtained from normal 
subjects, although this could be enhanced by either exogenous interferon-gamma 
or cell contact with fixed activated T lymphocytes. Further investigations 
demonstrated that monocyte-T cell contact enhanced M. leprae-induced TNF-alpha 
production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells of ENL patients and was 
modulated by blocking antibodies to CD40L, CD69, and CD18. These results suggest 
that physical contact with T cells isolated from patients in a particular 
disease state (ENL) modulates monocyte function and may contribute to the 
secretion of proinflammatory cytokines described in ENL.

Serological study for presence of C-reactive protein, rheumatoid factor, anti 
streptolysin O in leprosy cases.

Bhatia VN, Balakrishnan S, Harikrishnan S.

Serological tests for the detection of C-reactive protein (CRP), Rheumatoid 
factor (RE) and Anti Streptolysin 'O' (ASLO) antibodies employing latex test 
were carried out in 120 cases of active lepromatous leprosy, 14 LL cases with 
ENL during active and subsided phases and 25 controls. Out of 120 LL cases 25.8% 
gave a positive reaction to CRP and ASLO. Only 4.2% of the cases with LL were 
positive for Rheumatoid factor. None of the controls showed positive reaction in 
these tests. During ENL, 100% of the sera showed positive test for CRP as 
against 35.7% during subsidence of reaction. Tests for RF were positive in 28.5% 
of the cases ENL as compared to none during subsided ENL. Raised ASLO titers 
were noticed in 38.2% cases with active ENL as against 21.4% during subsided 
phase of ENL.

The effect of anti-reactional drugs on complement components in the type II, 
erythema nodosum leprosum, reaction.

Sehgal VN(1), Sharma V, Sharma VK.

Author information:

Delhi, India.

Seventeen patients with the type II (erythema nodosum leprosum) (ENL) reaction 
were studied. They received multidrug therapy and also the anti-reactional drugs 
prednisolone clofazimine or chloroquin, and we measured serum levels of 
complement components before treatment and after the reaction had subsided. 
Factor B was significantly elevated after treatment with each of the three 
drugs. C3 levels were significantly increased after treatment, the largest 
change being in patients treated with clofazimine. In these patients there was 
also a concomitant decrease in C3d levels. This suggests that clofazimine has 
complement modulating activity and we would recommend it as the drug of choice 
in treatment of the ENL reaction.

Polymorphonuclear cell function in the various polar types of leprosy and 
erythema nodosum leprosum.

Sher R, Anderson R, Glover A, Wadee AA.

Polymorphonuclear leukocyte motility, both in vivo and in vitro, and reduction 
of Nitro Blue Tetrazolium was studied in tuberculoid and lepromatous leprosy 
patients and a group of lepromatous patients with erythema nodosum leprosum 
(ENL). A profound defect in random migration, chemotaxis, and chemokinesis was 
found in lepromatous patients with and without complicating ENL, and marked 
depletion of skin window migration confirmed these in vitro findings. 
Tuberculoid patients exhibited a mild defect in polymorphonuclear leukocyte 
motility. Serum inhibitors of normal polymorphonuclear leukocyte chemotaxis were 
found in all types of leprosy, but sera from lepromatous and ENL patients were 
most inhibitory. Resting levels of Nitro Blue Tetrazolium reduction were normal 
in all three groups. Reconstitution of polymorphonuclear leukocyte cells from 
normal and ENL patients with ENL serum, however, showed increased Nitro Blue 
Tetrazolium reduction well above the normal range, whereas reconstitution with 
normal, lepromatous, and tuberculoid sera failed to increase Nitro Blue 
Tetrazolium reduction above the normal values.

Non-Hodgkin's extranodal lymphoma: a clinico-pathological study of 24 cases 
involving head and neck sites.

(1)Head and Neck Oncology Group, University College Hospital, London.

A series of 24 patients with a documented diagnosis of non-Hodgkin's extranodal 
lymphoma (ENL) involving head and neck sites (excluding the cranial cavity) has 
been studied. In view of recent advances in the diagnosis of lymphoma, a 
retrospective histopathological review has been undertaken to place all patients 
in standardized classifications for morphology (the working formulation) and 
immunology (Kiel). This resulted in a change of diagnosis from non-Hodgkin's 
lymphoma in four. The histopathology of these four cases, and the implication of 
such changed diagnoses are discussed. Of the 20 patients confirmed as having 
non-Hodgkin's ENL, 16 had primary ENL and four had an ENL focus secondary to 
disease elsewhere. Three patients in this series had an initial diagnosis made 
of another malignancy, but histopathological review prior to treatment changed 
the diagnosis to ENL. Details of presentation, pretreatment evaluation, 
immunohistochemistry, treatment and course have been analysed. The principal 
treatment policy for primary ENL has been radiotherapy. Of the 12 patients who 
received this treatment ten achieved a complete response (83 per cent). Eight 
remain free of disease at the time of writing. The role of adjuvant chemotherapy 
is also considered.

Fibrinolytic phenomenon in leprosy.

Jadhav VH(1), Jadhav MV, Sapatnekar SM, Joshi PB.

Author information:
(1)Dr. Bandorawalla Leprosy Hospital, Kondhawa, Pune.

Fibrinolytic activity in eighty-one patients with different types of leprosy and 
thirty-two normal healthy controls was studied by Euglobulin Lysis Time Method, 
Fibrinolytic activity was markedly decreased in patients with lepromatous 
leprosy and those with ENL reaction. Decline in fibrinolytic activity during ENL 
was independent of frequency of attacks. Fibrinolytic activity was partly 
restored after subsidence of ENL reaction, though it failed to attain normal 
levels. Cutaneous vasculitis seems to be most probable cause of fall in 
fibrinolytic activity in lepromatous leprosy and ENL reaction.

IgG subclass antibodies to mycobacterial sonicate and recombinant antigens in 
leprosy.

Author information:
(1)Department of Immunology, School of Biological Sciences, Madurai Kamaraj 
University, India.

In this study the IgG subclass antibodies to sonicated preparations of 
Mycobacterium leprae (leprosin A) and BCG (BCG-S) as well as to purified 
recombinant 65 kDa protein of M. leprae (rML65) were analysed in sera from 
leprosy patients and healthy household contacts (HFC) and noncontacts (HNC) in a 
leprosy endemic population. In LBI+ (lepromatous bacterial index positive) 
patients, IgG3 was predominant in the responses to sonicated antigens of M. 
leprae. Following chemotherapy, IgG3 responses were reduced while IgG2 levels 
were increased. On the other hand, IgG response to rML65 was dominated by IgG1 
in all the patient and control groups. Interestingly, the level of antileprosin 
A IgG antibody in erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) was similar to that of 
lepromatous groups, while the level of anti-rML65 IgG antibody was significantly 
reduced in ENL. IgG4 antibodies to the antigens studied were only at low levels 
in all groups, including ENL. Significant differences were observed between HNC 
and HFC in the pattern of IgG subclass antibodies to sonicated antigens, even 
though their antigen specific IgG levels were similar. While HNC showed 
equivalent proportion of IgG1 and IgG2 in their responses to leprosin A and 
BCG-S, HFC showed a specific increase in IgG1 levels, suggesting that both 
groups are distinctly different. Further studies are required to elucidate the 
functional significance of IgG subclass pattern in pathogenesis and the 
mechanism of immunoregulation resulting in the high levels of IgG1 and IgG3 
antibodies to M. leprae protein antigens in lepromatous leprosy.

United Kingdom. tomres@doctors.org.uk

BACKGROUND: To evaluate the clinical outcome of primary endonasal laser assisted 
dacryocystorhinostomy (ENL-DCR) using the potassium-titanyl-phosphate laser.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed all primary ENL-DCRs performed within a 
period of twelve months by the same combined Ophthalmology and 
Otorhinolaringology team in Freeman Hospital, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK. The main 
outcome measure for success was resolution or significant improvement of 
epiphora. Details of surgery, intraoperative and postoperative complications, as 
well as pathology associated with failure were also studied. Patients were 
followed up for at least 12 months.
RESULTS: A total of 41 consecutive ENL-DCRs on 29 patients (22 females, 7 males, 
mean age 75 years) were analysed. All patients had bicanalicular silicone 
intubation for at least 4 months. The success rate at 12 months postoperatively 
was 78.1%. Pathology associated with failure included: intranasal pathology 
(12.2%), mucocele (7.3%), and systemic sarcoidosis (2.4%). No significant 
intra-operative complications were recorded.
CONCLUSION: The ENL-DCR with potassium-titanyl-phosphate laser can be considered 
as a safe and efficient primary procedure for the treatment of nasolacrimal duct 
obstruction.

Treated Whipple disease with erythema nodosum leprosum-like lesions: cutaneous 
PAS-positive macrophages slowly decrease with time and are associated with 
lymphangiectases: a case report.

Paul J(1), Schaller J, Rohwedder A, Carlson JA.

Author information:

Albany Medical College, Albany, NY, USA.

Pathologically, Whipple disease (WD) is characterized by the accumulation of 
myriad macrophages parasitized by Tropheryma whipplei (TW) bacilli denoted by 
periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) positivity. These PAS+ macrophages are typically 
found in the duodenum associated with lymphangiectasia. Recently, we reported 
the presence of PAS+ macrophages and free TW in erythema nodosum leprosum 
(ENL)-like lesions and normal skin in a patient with WD who suffered from the 
immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). We extend that report by 
describing the clinical and pathologic findings over 5 years of follow-up. 
First, the IRIS gradually diminished and abated over 18-month time. Second, at 
no point did WD recur, and all duodenal and skin biopsies tested by polymerase 
chain reaction were negative for TW DNA. Third, PAS+ macrophages were identified 
in 26 of 27 skin biopsies (96%) and decreased along with free TW over time. 
Fourth, ENL-like lesions had significantly greater numbers of PAS+ macrophages 
than normal skin. Moreover, normal abdominal skin (region of ENL-like lesions) 
had greater PAS+ counts than arm skin (not a site of IRIS). Last, 
lymphangiectases, a histologic sign of lymphostasis, was found in all skin 
biopsies. Overall, these findings implicate bacillary burden as a factor in the 
immune tolerance to live TW in active WD and the initiation of ENL-like nodules 
against dead/nonreplicative TW in treated WD. In addition, poor lymphatic 
drainage is likely responsible for the gradual clearance of TW from the skin and 
the impaired delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction (absence of activated 
macrophages) against TW found in WD, presumptively due to reduced/absent immune 
cell trafficking necessary for lymphocyte-macrophage interactions and induction 
of adaptive immunity.

Serum lysozyme in leprosy.

Naik SS, Gurnani S.

Serum lysozyme was assessed in 43 healthy subjects and 183 leprosy patients. 
Significantly elevated level of lysozyme was observed in sera of leprosy 
patients as compared to normal individuals. The enzyme levels in leprosy of 
different types showed elevations in following order, Erythema Nodosum Leprosum 
(ENL) greater than Lepromatous greater than Borderline greater than Tuberculoid. 
Enzyme levels in patients with inactive stage were lower than in untreated 
patients. The serum lysozyme level correlated well with the activity disease in 
leprosy--clinically and bacteriologically. Thus the estimation of serum lysozyme 
can be used as one of the parameters of activity of the disease.

[Effectiveness of thalidomide for erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL): retrospective 
study of 20 Japanese cases in National Sanatrium Oku-Komyoen].

[Article in Japanese]

Matsuki T, Okano Y, Aoki Y, Ishida Y, Hatano K, Kumano K.

Thalidomide is a TNF-alpha inhibitor and has been administrated for erythema 
nodosum leprosum (ENL, Type II leprosy reaction) which is one of leprosy 
reactions and can cause serious illness to patients oflepromatous pole among the 
immune spectrum. Twenty live cases (at May, 2011) were identified to whom 
thalidomide had been administrated since 1978 for their ENL reactions. Data were 
collected from their clinical records in order to evaluate the usage and 
effectiveness of thalidomide in National Sanatorium Oku-Komyoen, Okayama, 
Setouchi-city, Japan. Individual data includes bacillary index (BI), total dose, 
average daily dose, maximum daily dose, minimum daily dose, methods of 
thalidomide administration and change of symptoms of ENL. Results: No adverse 
effect was found among 20 cases. Average daily dose of 20 cases was 19 mg. 
Regarding to the maximum daily dose, in 3 cases (15%) more than 100 mg, in 3 
cases (15%) 50 mg, and in 14 cases (70%) less than 40 mg was administrated. Dose 
was gradually tapered in most cases. From clinical records, thalidomide was 
found effective for ENL in 19 cases and clinicians concerned were trying to 
adjust the proper dose of the drug carefully depending on the current symptoms, 
because there was no guideline of thalidomide administration for ENL. This data 
suggests that even less than 50-100 mg as the initial daily dose was still 
effective, though 50-100 mg daily dose is recommended in the current guideline 
of Japan (2011) and more dose had been administrated in USA and India.

Sequential erythema nodosum leprosum and reversal reaction with similar lesional 
cytokine mRNA patterns in a borderline leprosy patient.

We compare the clinical and histological data with the immunological status of a 
borderline leprosy patient who experienced an erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) 
reaction followed by a reversal reaction (RR) after 12 weeks of 
anti-inflammatory treatment (pentoxifylline, PTX, 1200 mg daily). Skin biopsies, 
serum and blood samples were collected sequentially during the reactional 
episodes. At the outset of RR, the patient's lymphocytes secreted interferon 
(IFN) -gamma and there was a positive lymphoproliferative test in response to 
Mycobacterium leprae, which had been absent during ENL. The lepromin reaction 
reversed from negative (0 mm) at diagnosis, to positive (3 mm) 3 months after 
the development of RR. Tumour necrosis factor (TNF) -alpha levels in the serum 
decreased after 1 week of treatment and increased slightly thereafter. The 
immunohistochemical data for ENL showed a diffuse dermal and hypodermal 
infiltrate composed of mononuclear cells and neutrophils, while RR was 
characterized by an epithelioid granulomatous infiltrate with a marked presence 
of gammadelta T cells. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction showed a 
mixed cytokine profile characterized by the expression of TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, 
interleukin (IL) -6, IL-10 and IL-12 mRNA in the skin, which persisted 
throughout the development of ENL and RR lesions. IL-4 mRNA, first detected 
after 7 days of PTX treatment, was still present during RR. The results suggest 
the emergence of an initial Th0-like cytokine profile in ENL, typical of a state 
of immunoactivation, before conditions optimal for the appearance of an 
antigen-specific cell-mediated immune response and gammadelta T-cell migration 
are created.

Thalidomide's effectiveness in erythema nodosum leprosum is associated with a 
decrease in CD4+ cells in the peripheral blood.

Thalidomide is well documented as being an effective drug in the treatment of 
erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL). The mechanism of action of thalidomide in ENL 
as well as the pathogenesis of ENL are yet to be fully determined. Lepromatous 
leprosy patients experiencing ENL have been reported to have an increase in the 
ratio of CD4+ to CD8+ cells in their blood and ENL skin lesions. Thalidomide has 
been shown to cause a decrease in the ratio of CD4+ to CD8+ lymphocytes in the 
blood of healthy males. This decrease was due to a significant reduction in the 
numbers of Cd4+ lymphocytes and an apparent increase in the numbers of CD8+ 
lymphocytes. In this study, thalidomide's effectiveness in halting chronic ENL 
and arresting a relapse into ENL was consistently associated with a decrease in 
the numbers of CD4+ lymphocytes in the blood of 2 male lepromatous leprosy 
patients.

Annular bullous lesions with atypical erythema multiforme in leprosy.

Shah A, Mahajan R, Ninama K, Bilimoria F.

Erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) is an immune complex-mediated reaction that may 
complicate the course of multibacillary leprosy. Bullous lesions in Type II 
reaction, though reported, are exceedingly rare. We report the case of a 32 year 
old female patient who presented initially at our OPD with erythema nodosum. 
Cutaneous examination revealed impaired sensation over dorsum of right foot and 
thickened right lateral popliteal nerve. Slit skin smear (SSS) from ear lobes 
revealed AFB with a bacteriological index of 2+. She was started on MDT, tablet 
ofloxacin 200 mg twice a day, and 30 mg oral prednisolone. Two months later, she 
presented with generalised pruritus, large target lesions over the back, and 
hemorrhagic bullae over lower extremities and annular pattern of bullae, over 
both arms. A SSS was repeated which was positive for AFB. Histopathology from 
bullous lesions was consistent with ENL. Direct Immunofluorescence (DIF) study 
was negative. Our patient improved rapidly after she was started on thalidomide 
100 mg twice daily, with withdrawal of ofloxacin. Erythema Multiforme (EMF) and 
annular bullous lesions have been reported in patients on treatment with 
ofloxacin. This case is being presented due to the unusual and varied 
manifestation of Type II lepra reaction in a 34 year old female patient.

Serum immunoglobulins an autoantibodies during and after erythema nodosum 
leprosum (ENL).

Sharma VK, Saha K, Sehgal VN.

Sera from 20 patients with lepromatous leprosy complicated by erythema nodosum 
leprosum (ENL) were collected at the time of acute reaction and then after 
clinical cure four weeks later. Anti-ENL drugs used were: prednisolone (11 
patients), chloroquin (6 patients), and clofazimine (3 patients). 
Immunoglobulins M, G, and A and autoantibodies, namely, antithyroglobulin 
antibody (ATA), antinuclear antibody (ANA), and rheumatoid factor (RF), were 
measured in these 20 paired serum samples. The mean serum concentration of IgG 
showed a significant elevation after clinical subsidence of the reaction, mainly 
in the prednisolone treated group; while those of IgM and IgA varied only 
marginally. Autoantibodies were detected in nine patients. Of these, three 
patients developed these antibodies only after remission of the reaction. 
Treatment with prednisolone and chloroquin, although causing subsidence of ENL, 
resulted in an increased incidence of ATA and/or ANA. Furthermore, it was 
observed that longer duration of illness, higher age group, and history of 
repeated attacks of ENL predisposed these patients to enhanced autoantibody 
formation.

Activation of complement by Mycobacterium leprae requires disruption of the 
bacilli.

(1)Laboratory Research Branch, National Hansen's Disease Programs, Louisiana 
State University, Baton Rouge, 70803 USA.

OBJECTIVE: The immune-mediated events that precipitate erythema nodosum leprosum 
(ENL) are not well understood. One component may be the complexing of antibody 
with antigens released from infected macrophages, the activation of complement 
and the subsequent local inflammation. We assess here the ability of 
highly-purified, disrupted M. leprae, to activate complement.
RESULTS: Intact and sonically-disrupted crude and alkali-purified nu/nu 
mouse-derived M. leprae suspensions were incubated with normal serum and a 
hemolytic titer (CH50) was determined as a measure of complement fixation. Crude 
M. leprae consumed complement, and disrupted preparations more than the intact. 
Purified M. leprae preparations did not consume complement unless disrupted.
CONCLUSION: M. leprae, if disrupted, can activate complement. This supports a 
hypothesis that links released antigens with ENL, and may explain the increased 
probability of an occurrence of ENL following chemotherapy.

Pulsed corticosteroid therapy in patients with chronic recurrent ENL: a pilot 
study.

Girdhar A(1), Chakma JK, Girdhar BK.

Author information:
(1)Central JALMA Institute for Leprosy, Tajganj, Agra-282 001.

A pilot study has been undertaken to compare the efficacy of small dose pulsed 
betamethasone therapy with need based oral steroids in chronic recurrent 
erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) patients. Though this mode of therapy was well 
tolerated, no advantage with intermittent steroid administration was observed. 
This could have been on account of small dose of steroid given monthly. 
Treatment of chronic recurrent erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) patients 
continues to be unsatisfactory, particularly, because of nonavailability of 
thalidomide. Though corticosteroids are effective in suppressing all the 
manifestations and even restoring partially or fully the functional impairment, 
their side effects and dependence are equally troublesome. Based on (a) the 
reported efficacy and safety of intermittent use of corticosteroids in several 
immune complex mediated disorders (Cathcart et al 1976, Kimberly et al 1979), 
Liebling et al 1981 and Pasricha & Gupta 1984) and (b) ENL (type II) reactions 
having similar pathology, a pilot study has been undertaken to see the efficacy 
and the tolerance of pulsed steroids in chronic ENL patients.

[First line endonasal dacryocystorhinostomy Technique and results. Comparison 
between diode laser and electrocautery instrument. Study based on 422 
procedures].

Limon, 28 rue de Charenton, 75012 Paris, France.

PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: To assess the results of the first procedures of 
endoscopic endonasal dacryocystorhinostomy (ENL DCR). To study the efficiency of 
diode laser in this operation versus electrocautery instruments (ECI).
DESIGN: Prospective study; comparative study.
METHODS: Intraoperative comparison between ECI and diode laser is based on 422 
ENL DCR achieved between June 1997 until June 2000. Three hundreds and sixty 
three procedures were diode laser assisted and 59 procedures were done with the 
use of an ECI. The diode laser was only used to vaporize nasal mucosa laying on 
the osteotomy site, to realize partial turbinectomy and to vaporize polyps and 
synechiae. Intraoperative comparison was based on the followings: frequency and 
extent of bleeding, quality of visibility, perception of pain during the use of 
the instrument and duration of the operation. Postoperative comparison is based 
on 318 procedures. Comparison was based on: frequency of granuloma formation in 
the nasal mucosa at the site of the osteotomy, frequency of acquired nasal 
synechiae, frequency of important crusting reaction of the nasal mucosa; success 
rates after a minimum follow up of 6 months.
RESULTS: Intraoperative haemorrhages were fewer and smaller in the diode laser 
assisted procedures than in ECI assisted procedures; visibility was better with 
the diode laser; the use of the diode laser was painless versus 24% of patients 
complaining of pain during the use of electro-cautery. The duration of the 
procedure was shorter with the diode laser (29'30 vs 37'). In the postoperative 
follow-up frequency of granuloma formation was equal with the two instruments, 
synechiae were fewer with the diode laser (11% vs 22%) just like crusting 
reaction of the nasal mucosa (7% vs 36%). Success rates were similar (diode 
laser: 91.94% vs EC: 86.66%).
CONCLUSION: Because of the effeciency of the vaporization and coagulation, the 
diode laser, in comparison with the ECI, allows to shorten mean operative time, 
to improve the visibility and to decrase bleeding. Contrary to EC it's use is 
painless. Fewer important crusting reactions and fewer synechiae after diode 
laser assisted procedures tend to prove than postoperative inflammation and 
surgical trauma are smaller than with ECI. There is no statiscally signifant 
difference between the success rates of ENL laser diode assisted procedures and 
ENL ECI assisted procedures.

Solubilization of preformed immune complexes in sera of patients with type 1 and 
type 2 lepra reactions.

Chakrabarty AK(1), Kashyap A, Sehgal VN, Saha K.

Author information:
(1)Department of Biochemistry, University College of Medical Sciences, Shahdara, 
Delhi, India.

Serum complement activity in leprosy patients has been studied using 
solubilization of preformed immune complexes as an index. The solubilization 
capacity of sera from lepromatous patients with or without erythema nodosum 
leprosum (ENL) as well as from type 1 reactional patients was found markedly 
reduced as compared to controls. Solubilization did not improve at all in the 
ENL patients after remission of the reaction phase. The addition of fresh normal 
sera failed to bring about any significant restoration of solubilizing capacity 
of the deficient sera. Mycobacterium leprae sonicate significantly reduced the 
solubilization capacity. Our results suggest that circulating mycobacterial 
breakdown products possibly interfered with the capacity of the ENL patients' 
sera to solubilize immune complexes.

Thalidomide does not modify the ability of cells in leprosy patients to 
incorporate [3H]-thymidine when incubated with M. leprae antigens.

Author information:

The immune response in reversal reaction, (RR) and in erythema nodosum leprosum 
(ENL) is characterized in vitro by an enhancement in lymphocyte blast 
transformation against M. leprae. As thalidomide is an effective treatment for 
ENL, this study assessed the effect of this drug on these phenomena. Mononuclear 
cells from patients attending the clinic at ALERT and from healthy staff were 
cultured for 5 days with integral M. leprae (IMl), or a modified Dharmendra 
antigen (Dhar), or PPD from M. tuberculosis. In one set of cultures, thalidomide 
was added once at the initiation of the culture; in the other set thalidomide 
was added a second time (2x), 18 h prior to harvesting the cells. The 
mononuclear cells, in the absence of thalidomide, from healthy staff, borderline 
tuberculoid patients (BT) and BT patients in RR (BT/RR) incorporated 
[3H]-thymidine best when cultured with PPD > Dhar > M. leprae. The cells from 
patients with ENL did not respond well to the M. leprae antigens. Thalidomide 
(2x) enhanced proliferation to Dhar in the BTRR group (Wilcoxon signed rank 
test, P < 0.05). No significant changes occurred for the other groups. Comparing 
PPD-stimulated cells treated with thalidomide once to those treated with 
thalidomide twice, thalidomide (2x) suppressed incorporation of [H3]-thymidine 
by the PPD-stimulated (P < 0.05) as well as IMl-stimulated (P < 0.05) cells in 
the healthy staff group. In the Dhar-stimulated cells from the healthy staff 
thalidomide significantly suppressed TNF-alpha (P < 0.05). A mixed effect was 
seen within and between the other groups, but there was a trend for thalidomide 
to suppress TNF-alpha induced by the M. leprae, Dhar and PPD antigens.

Does pentoxifylline find a place in the armementarium of leprologists in type II 
reaction?

Chatterjee M(1), Jaiswal AK.

Author information:
(1)Military Hospital, Jabalpur 482 001, Madhya Pradesh, India.

Alternative therapeutic interventions in Type II lepra reaction are being 
considered following serious problems associated with the use of steroids and 
thalidomide. Pentoxifylline (PTX) has been used in Type II reaction with varying 
degrees of success. The results of a study on the use of this drug in a dose of 
1200 mg per day for a period of 2 months in patients with ENL reaction are 
discussed. Five patients, one of whom was HIV positive--all with severe Type II 
reaction, were regularly evaluated for regression of inflammatory symptoms and 
clinical involution of ENL lesions while on PTX therapy and thereafter. It was 
found that PTX led to a total elimination of systemic symptoms within a week. 
ENL lesions regressed in two weeks. However, in one patient, lesions recurred 
after one month of therapy. It appears that PTX is well tolerated and could be 
used as an additional drug in the armamentarium of leprologists in the 
management of Type II reaction, especially in HIV co-infection, where long-term 
steroids are contraindicated. However, further studies to compare the effects of 
PTX with currently, widely used drugs for the treatment of ENL reaction are 
necessary.

Evaluation of audiovestibular status in leprosy.

Singh TR, Agrawal SK, Bajaj AK, Singh RK, Singh MM.

One hundred twenty five cases of lepromatous leprosy and 25 cases of tuberculoid 
leprosy were investigated for audiovestibular status. Impaired hearing was 
detected in 52 percent and vestibular hypofuction in 7.2 per cent of lepromatous 
cases. Conductive deafness was due to eustachian tube catarrh secondary to 
atrophic rhinitis associated with the disease. The perceptive deafness and 
vestibular hypofuction were due to end organ lesion probably due to E.N.L. 
reaction. The vestibulococlear nerve involvement was considered to be unlikely. 
In tuberculoid leprosy derangement in hearing was not observed in any cases.

Thalidomide is the drug of choice in the treatment of severe erythema nodosum 
leprosum (ENL) in men. It has recently been associated with deep venous 
thrombosis (DVT) when used in treatment of refractory multiple myeloma along 
with combination chemotherapy. We report a case of DVT in a patient treated for 
ENL with corticosteroids and thalidomide, and suggest a possible mechanism for 
the association.

C-reactive protein and apoB containing lipoproteins are associated with 
Mycobacterium leprae in lesions of human leprosy.

Ridley MJ, Ridley DS, De Beer FC, Pepys MB.

Skin biopsies from patients with leprosy across the spectrum from tuberculoid 
(TT) to lepromatous (LL), including histoid lepromas and erythema nodosum 
leprosum (ENL) reactions, were stained immunohistochemically for the presence of 
C-reactive protein (CRP) and the apolipoprotein, apoB. Mycobacterium leprae 
bacillary material comprising cell walls, cytoplasmic and soluble components was 
present with increasing abundance towards the lepromatous end of the spectrum 
and always stained positively with anti-CRP. M. leprae from armadillos did not 
stain with anti-human CRP indicating that the staining of M. leprae in human 
tissues was not due to a cross-reaction between anti-CRP and the organism 
itself. When CRP was present in large amounts apoB was also demonstrated in the 
same distribution. CRP was detected on bacilli and their degradation products 
within the cytoplasm of macrophages even in the absence of a raised serum CRP 
level in some ENL patients and also in two cases of advanced resolving lepromas. 
These findings demonstrate remarkable persistence of CRP in association with M. 
leprae in vivo, and raise intriguing questions about the possible role of CRP in 
relation to the handling of leprosy bacilli.

Enumeration of sub-population of T cells with receptors for Fc portion of Ig G 
(Tr) and Fc portion of Ig M (Tu) and B lymphocytes in the peripheral blood of 39 
Lepromatous, 44 ENL and 22 Post ENL patients were undertaken. ENL patients 
showed significant decreased Tr cell percentage than Lepromatous and Post ENL 
patients. Although T mu cell percentage was lowered in ENL patients, a 
relatively elevated T mu/Tr ratio was found than Lepromatous and Post ENL 
patients indicating elevation of helper activity in ENL. B cells did not 
register any change in the three stages.

Suppressed natural killer cell activity during episodes of erythema nodosum 
leprosum in lepromatous leprosy.

Humphres RC, Gelber RH, Krahenbuhl JL.

Natural killer (NK) cell activity was investigated in peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells of patients with leprosy. The NK activity of patients with 
borderline or lepromatous leprosy did not differ significantly from that of 
normal subjects. However, in a group of patients with lepromatous leprosy 
undergoing an episode of erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL), NK activity was 
significantly depressed. In four patients with ENL, NK activity was virtually 
abolished. Depressed NK activity could not be attributed to the effects of 
corticosteroid therapy, nor did a serum factor appear to be responsible. 
Evidence was obtained that depressed NK activity in patients with ENL was not 
due to dysfunction of the NK cells themselves; they functioned normally when 
separated from the individual's total mononuclear cell population. Additional 
cell depletion studies suggested that the patients' monocytes were responsible 
for the observed depression of NK activity.

In order to increase our understanding of the immunological basis of erythema 
nodosum leprosum (ENL), we studied Th-like cytokine profiles in 130 leprosy 
patients, employing both the conventional and a novel, real-time, fluorogenic 
reverse transcriptase-based PCR (RT-PCR). The concomitant expression of both 
Th-like cytokines, interferon-gamma and IL-4, and the regulatory cytokines, 
IL-10 and IL-12, was studied in the peripheral blood cells of leprosy patients 
with and without ENL. In the conventional RT-PCR, varied cytokine profiles were 
observed in individual patients of all clinical types. Fifty-three percent of 
lepromatous patients without ENL and 59% of tuberculoid leprosy patients showed 
co-expression of IFN gamma and IL-4, indicating a non-polarized Th 0 pattern. Of 
the 36 patients with ENL, 58% demonstrated a polarized Th 1 pattern, with only 
30% expressing both cytokines. Semiquantitative RT-PCR indicated a lower 
expression of IL-4 compared to that of IFN gamma in the lepromatous patients 
without ENL; the difference was even greater among those with ENL. The 
sensitive, real-time PCR confirmed the down-regulation of IL-4 and IL-10, with 
absence of IL-4 in half of the patients, resulting in skewing of the cytokine 
response toward a Th 1-like profile.

Reaction cases treated at the Regional Leprosy Training and Research Institute, 
Aska, Orissa: a retrospective analysis.

Santaram V(1), Porichha D.

Author information:
(1)Regional Leprosy Training and Research Institute, Aska 761110, Ganjam, 
Orissa.

This study is a retrospective analysis of 147 cases of leprosy reaction selected 
out of 942 cases of leprosy registered between 1992 and 2002 at the RLTRI, Aska 
(Orissa). The occurrence of reaction was about 16% with a slight increase over 
the years. There was a preponderance of males, with about 80% cases among males, 
and the peak occurrence of reaction was found in the age-group of 21-49 years. 
Reversal reaction (RR) was seen in 68.7% and ENL in 31.3% of cases. Single 
episode of RR and ENL reactions was seen in 61.2% and 43.5% respectively. In 
either type the last episode was seen even after about 32 months after RFT. 
There was a dissociation between nerve and skin manifestation, with both skin 
and nerve manifestation in 78.96%, skin lesions only in 21.1% and nerve lesions 
only in 50.9% of cases. About 88% of reaction was seen in MB patients, with a 
higher proportion of RR, because of inclusion of more borderline cases. 
Prednisolone was the drug of choice in both types of reaction, though in 17 
cases of steroid dependency, thalidomide was proved to have an edge over 
steroids. Both types taken together, in half of the cases the first episode of 
reaction developed within 6 months of starting treatment. Multiple episodes were 
more common with ENL.

Changes in circulating antibody levels to the major phenolic glycolipid during 
erythema nodosum leprosum in leprosy patients.

Andreoli A, Brett SJ, Draper P, Payne SN, Rook GA.

Circulating antibody levels to the phenolic glycolipid from Mycobacterium leprae 
and soluble M. leprae antigens were monitored before, during and following ENL 
episodes in 12 patients. It was observed that during ENL reaction, there was a 
fall in circulating antibody levels to the phenolic glycolipid but not to the 
soluble antigens from M. leprae. When the patients had recovered from their ENL 
reactions, the anti-glycolipid antibody levels usually increased again to levels 
similar to those observed before the ENL reaction.

Erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) or Type-2 Lepra reaction is a manifestation of 
type III hypersensitivity response and usually occurs in certain cases of 
lepromatous and borderline lepromatous leprosy. It is usually generalized and 
evanescent, and responds well to oral corticosteroid therapy. Here we report an 
unusual case of persistent and localized ENL in a 19-year-old girl, which could 
be diagnosed with the aid of skin biopsy and histopathological examination.

The histopathology of type I (lepra) and type II (ENL) reactions in leprosy.

Sehgal VN, Gautam RK, Koranne RV, Beohar PC.

The histopathological features in type I (lepra) reaction comprised a loose and 
disorganised granuloma in the upper and mid-dermis, dermal edema and variable 
cellular contents, namely, epithelioid cells, lymphocytes, giant cells, and 
macrophages. While ENL reactions, were characterised by predominant involvement 
of subcutaneous vessels, vasculitis, and polymorphonuclear infiltration in and 
around the blood vessels.

College, Shimla, Himachal Pradesh, India.

Thalidomide, a racemic glutamic acid analogue, was first developed in 1954 and 
subsequently marketed in Europe, Australia and Canada as a sedative and 
anti-emetic. It was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the 
USA in 1998 for the treatment of the cutaneous manifestations of moderate to 
severe erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) and suppression of the cutaneous 
manifestations of ENL recurrences. It is a good choice for management in 
patients who are dependent on corticosteroids. Common side effects of 
thalidomide are teratogenicity, peripheral neuropathy, sedation and 
constipation. We report 4 cases of Hansen's disease with recurrent ENL who were 
adequately managed on thalidomide. On sudden withdrawal of thalidomide, they 
relapsed with severe type 2 reaction including necrotic ENL.

Erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) classically presents as tender, erythematous 
nodules over the face, arms and legs. Severe ENL can become vesicular or bullous 
and break-down and is termed erythema necroticans (Jopling & McDougall, 1996) 
and is treated with corticosteroids. The causes of death in a majority of 
leprosy patients are the same as in the general population, with the exception 
of renal damage in lepromatous leprosy. There is possible increased mortality 
from side-effects of antileprosy drugs, steroids, or other drugs used in 
reactions, from toxaemia in severe reactions, and from asphyxia due to glottic 
oedema (Jopling & McDougall, 1996). We report here a case of erythema 
necroticans, the cause of death being septicaemia, secondary to skin ulcers and 
urinary tract infection, precipitated by corticosteroids.

The word "reaction" is used in leprosy to describe signs and symptoms of acute 
inflammation. Type II reactions, including erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) occur 
in the multibacillary forms of Hansen's disease. Nitric oxide (NO) could play a 
role in the response of the host, where a high NO production would be involved 
in acute inflammatory processes. In this paper we evaluate NO production in 
serum and in the supernatants of mononuclear cell cultures (MNCC), measured 
indirectly by Griess' method. The results obtained in serum showed that 52% of 
patients with ENL (15/29) had a production over 30 microM, distributed as 
follows: 8/15 had a mean concentration of 36.38 +/- ?5.71 microM; 1/15, 70.5 
microM and 6/15 had a mean concentration greater than 100 microM (205.97 +/- 5 
microM). Forty eight percent presented nitrite and nitrate levels lower than 30 
microM (18.93 +/- 6.15). Only supernatants of mononuclear cell cultures from ENL 
patients collected at 120 hours of incubation presented NO production levels 
higher than 10 microM +/- 6.53, as compared with the supernatants from the 
stable polar forms of the disease (lepromatous leprosy and tuberculoid leprosy), 
where values were 2.52 microM +/- 1.18 and 2.69 microM +/- 1.07, respectively. 
These preliminary results show a different metabolic activity in the group of 
patients with Type II reaction state (ENL).

Thalidomide in lepra reaction (ENL) in lepromatous leprosy patients.

Chandorkar AG, Burte NP, Jadhav JH, Gade RK, Bulakh PM, Tayshete SN, Kale VM.

Six male bacteriologically highly positive patients of lepromatous leprosy with 
ENL reaction not adequately controlled by conventional antireaction drugs were 
put on thalidomide 400 mg per day in four divided doses. Reaction was controlled 
between 13th to 18th day of therapy. There was no change in the bacteriological 
status. Liver functions, renal functions and hemogram were normal before therapy 
and remained unaltered at the end of treatment. Apart from fatigue, drowsiness 
and occassional constipation, thalidomide had no adverse effect. Control of ENL 
reaction by thalidomide in these patients is probably due to its 
immunosuppressive effect, more likely by its stablising action on lysosomes.

Twenty-five patients with Type 1 (lepra) and Type 2 (ENL) reactions, were 
assayed for SIL-2R in serum--before and after treatment for their acute 
condition--and the results were compared with 10 normal healthy adults and 20 
patients of leprosy per se. Classification of each subject into different 
leprosy groups, and into various types and subtypes of reactions, was done 
according to standard criteria, prior to inclusion into the study. Detailed 
statistical evaluation of the data revealed significantly higher levels of 
SIL-2R in all leprosy patients, as compared to normal controls, with higher 
levels in the multibacillary groups as compared to the paucibacillary group. 
SIL-2Rs appeared higher in Type 1 upgrading reaction than in other forms of 
reaction, though this was not statistically significant. There was no 
significant change in levels following treatment and clinical remission.

Novel metabolites of the mammalian lignans enterolactone and enterodiol in human 
urine.

Enterolactone (ENL) and enterodiol (END) are found in high concentrations in 
human body fluids after ingestion of flaxseed and whole-grain products. Although 
much interest is presently focused on these mammalian lignans because of their 
putative beneficial health effects, little is known about their metabolic fate 
in humans. We have now identified nine novel metabolites of ENL and END in the 
urine of female and male humans ingesting flaxseed for five days. The chemical 
structures of six ENL metabolites and of three END metabolites were elucidated 
by GC/MS analysis and comparison with authentic reference compounds obtained by 
chemical synthesis. The six identified metabolites of ENL were the products of 
monohydroxylation at the para-position and at both ortho-positions of the parent 
hydroxy group of either aromatic ring. Likewise, the three END metabolites were 
formed through aromatic monohydroxylation at the para- and ortho-positions. The 
biological significance of these metabolites remains to be established.

IgG subclasses against lipoarabinomannan of mycobacteria were analyzed in the 
sera of leprosy patients. Patients with active leprosy [tuberculoid and 
lepromatous, patients undergoing erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) and reversal 
reactions] and inactive cases (tuberculoid and lepromatous who were cured after 
chemotherapy) were included in this study. Active lepromatous patients had 
higher levels of IgG subclasses, except IgG4, compared to active tuberculoid 
patients. Some of the inactive cases (lepromatous patients cured after 
chemotherapy) were positive for the IgG1, IgG2 and IgG3 subclasses. However, 
their levels are lower than active lepromatous cases. On the other hand, no 
difference in the subclass levels between the active and inactive tuberculoid 
groups could be observed. While a significant fall in the level of IgG3 in ENL 
was observed as compared to lepromatous leprosy without ENL, higher levels of 
IgG1 and IgG2 were found in patients with reversal reactions compared to their 
active counterparts without reactions.

1. A precision feeding experiment was conducted with turkeys, which had 
previously been fed diets with or without phytase, to study the effects on the 
excretions of endogenous energy (EEL), nitrogen (ENL), amino acids (EAAL) and 
minerals. 2. Female turkeys (BUT 6) which had been fed one of 4 experimental 
diets (low P maize-soya diets (control, C), C + 250 international units of 
phytase/kg diet (FTU), C + 500 FTU and C + 2500 FTU) were used in this study. 
All birds were fasted and then given 50 mL of glucose solution at 46 d of age. 
Birds were allocated to individual metabolism cages in a randomised block design 
with 8 replicates for each of the 4 previously-fed diets. 3. The response of EEL 
and ENL to phytase pre-exposure was linear. An increase of 100 FTU reduced the 
EEL and ENL by approximately 1·6 kJ and 20 mg respectively. The results suggest 
that a minimum activity of phytase of 500 FTU is needed to initiate the 
reduction of these losses. 4. Pre-exposure to phytase reduced the EAAL, which 
was best described as a linear response with increasing phytase dose in the 
pre-study period. An increase of 100 FTU reduced the losses of total endogenous 
amino acids by approximately 225 mg. 5. In contrast to the results for 
endogenous energy losses, turkeys pre-exposed to phytase linearly increased 
their excretions of Ca and Mg with increasing phytase activity in the pre-study 
period. 6. The effects of feeding turkeys with supplementary phytase continued 
for at least 4 d after the diets were withdrawn. This suggests that exposure to 
phytase alters the functionality and secretions of the gastrointestinal tract, 
which may influence the nutritive value of diets fed immediately after.

Immunotherapy with Mycobacterium w (M.w) vaccine was given to 45 patients with 
multibacillary (MB) leprosy; 41 similarly classified patients served as 
controls. All patients received standard multidrug therapy (MDT). Incidence, 
severity and frequency of type 2 (ENL) reactional episodes were monitored in 
both groups in a follow-up extending up to 4 years. Reactions were seen in fewer 
vaccinated (10/37) BL and LL patients than in the control group (12/34). A total 
of 20 episodes were recorded in the vaccine group as against 29 in the controls, 
75% of reactions were mild in vaccinated and 51.72% were mild in the control 
group patients, and 3 patients in the control group had more than 3 reactional 
episodes. None of the vaccinated patients showed this. No additional incidence 
of neuritis were seen among vaccinated individuals during reactional episodes.

(1)National Institute of Toxicology, Seville, Spain.

Chlorpromazine and other phenothiazine derivatives are neuroleptic drugs of 
widespread use for clinical situations beyond the realm of psychiatry, such as 
to control nausea, vomiting and intractable hiccups. The present study 
investigated in vitro different cytotoxic effects of chlorpromazine in cultures 
of mouse neuroblastoma cell line Neuro-2a exposed to different concentrations of 
this compound. Indicators assessed were cell proliferation by quantification of 
total protein content of the cell culture, lysosomal function evaluated by the 
relative uptake of neutral red cytosolic phosphofructokinase (PFK) and enolase 
(ENL) activities in glycolysis, mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) 
activity in the citric acid cycle, lysosomal beta-galactosidase (GAL) activity, 
and neuronal acetylcholinesterase activity. Marked inhibitory effects were found 
for cell proliferation and relative neutral red uptake; PFK, ENL and GAL 
activities had no significant differences from control. Stimulation was 
specifically detected on SDH and the Krebs cycle at concentrations up to 30 
microM. Chlorpromazine did not have high toxicity for cytotoxic effects on 
lysosomes.

Ultrastructural aspects of oral and facial lepromatous lesions.

Reichart PA, Metah D, Althoff J.

The ultrastructure of 10 lepromatous lesions in the face and the palatal mucosa 
after different duration and length of treatment was studied. Biopsies taken 
from patients who showed erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) revealed different 
ultrastructural characteristics from those taken from 'burnt out' and 
non-medicated cases. Multiple secondary lysosomes were rarely seen in non-ENL 
cases. The presence of Mycobacterium leprae and an increased lysosomal activity 
in ENL reactive cases is interpreted as a reaction to the lysis of the 
cytoplasmic matrix of M. leprae; however, drug-specific 
(diaminodiphenylsulphone) reactions must also be considered.

Epidermal changes in reactional leprosy: keratinocyte Ia expression as an

Thangaraj H(1), Laal S, Thangaraj I, Nath I.

Author information:
(1)Leprosy Mission Hospital, Shahadra, Delhi, India.

Significant epidermal changes were observed in lesions of leprosy patients 
undergoing type 1 (reversal) and type 2 (erythema nodosum leprosum, ENL) 
reactions. Using indirect immunofluorescence and frozen sections stained with 
the appropriate monoclonal antibodies, an increase in epidermal cell layers, the 
presence of Ia on keratinocytes, an increase in Langerhans' cell numbers, and 
scattered T cells within the epidermis were seen in both types of reactions. 
Although borderline tuberculoid patients with type 1 reactions showed the 
consistent presence of Ia on all keratinocytes, lepromatous patients undergoing 
ENL reactions showed only a patchy distribution. Taken together, these studies 
indicate that local T-cell activation leading to the production of terminal 
lymphokine, such as interferon-gamma, with subsequent induction of Ia on 
epidermal cells may be an important event in reactional leprosy states. It is of 
interest that the hitherto considered "anergic" lepromatous patients should 
recover temporary T-cell reactivity during the natural course of the disease.

Treatment of chronic erythema nodosum leprosum with cyclosporine A produces 
clinical and immunohistologic remission.

Miller RA(1), Shen JY, Rea TH, Harnisch JP.

Author information:

We have treated three leprosy patients suffering from chronic, steroid-dependent 
erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) with cyclosporine A (CsA). Excellent results 
were obtained in two patients. Extra-cutaneous manifestations of the reactional 
state were completely suppressed, and the development of new skin lesions was 
sharply curtailed. Immunohistologic abnormalities characteristic of active ENL 
were corrected. Lymphocyte subpopulations and anti-mycobacterial antibody levels 
in peripheral blood were unaffected. The third patient showed only a partial 
response to CsA, but satisfactory blood levels were never obtained in this 
individual because of dose-related gastrointestinal toxicity. The effectiveness 
of CsA in the treatment of ENL is consistent with the hypothesis that aberrant 
activation of a subset of T-helper cells is involved in the pathogenesis of this 
reaction. CsA may have a role in the treatment of chronic ENL that has failed to 
respond to conventional therapeutic modalities.

Author information:
(1)Division of Dermatology, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern 
California, Los Angeles, California, USA. rea@hsc.usc.edu

Changes in peripheral blood platelet counts associated with the onset of 
symptomatic erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) were studied by comparing, in each 
patient, the value obtained on the day thalidomide therapy commenced with the 
average of the three preceding values. In the 11 patients studied, the mean 
platelet count rose from 235 to 322 x 10(3)/mm3, p < 0.001. In 3, the platelet 
count was above the normal limit, qualifying as thrombocytosis, in 7 the rise 
was appreciable, and in 2 it was negligible. In the 3 patients studied 1-2 weeks 
after beginning thalidomide, the mean count was 414 x 10(3)/mm3. Counts obtained 
after 3 or more weeks of thalidomide therapy were within normal limits. This 
study provided no direct evidence as to the mechanism responsible for the 
elevated platelet count, but mediation by interleukin-6 (IL-6) was concluded to 
be an attractive hypothesis, consistent with prior studies of IL-6 in reactive 
thrombocytosis and of IL-6 in ENL.

The recent progress were focused on: the identification of the general 
immunological mechanism of the hansenian neuritis, demonstrated by endoneural 
biopsies; the different pathology of the two categories of neuritis; the 
pathophysiologic derangements, inducing hypoxia or anoxia in the truncular 
involved segment. The adjuvant role of the canals is important; the clinical 
differences of the two categories of neuritis and the cases we shall treat by 
emergency; the importance of antireactionnal treatment and of the notation by 
tests for the study of the results. The goals are the hemodynamic decompression, 
useful in the first stage of ENL neuritis, the mechanical decompression of 
neural fasciculus and the urgent exeresis of necroses or evacuation of febrile 
abscess. Three technics a re studied: Extraneural and epineural decompression 
fascicular endoneural necrosis, neurolysis and complex neurolysis for evaluated 
ENL neuritis and for endoneural necrosis. The different indication according to 
the two categories: medico-surgical treatment for ENL neuritis, and according 
the precocity and the delay of the antireactional treatment, and also the 
absolute emergency of the necrosis and febrile abscess. The results of the 
treatment of 258 cases of recent neuritis are presented.

Bacillaemia in lepra reaction: its correlation with liver pathology.

Zawar PB, Holla VV, Patil SM, Zawar MP, Chawhan RN.

Thirty patients of lepromatous leprosy in a state of reaction (ENL) were studied 
for bacillaemia and a correlation was made with liver pathology. Buffy coat 
smears were examined in all, eliminating as far as possible the chances of 
contamination of blood by the skin bacilli. Thirteen out of thirty patients 
showed presence of acid fast bacilli (AFB) in the buffy coat smear. Hepatic 
involvement in the form of leprous granuloma was observed in all, of which 93.3% 
showed presence of AFB. It is concluded that during reaction the possibility of 
heightened bacillaemia is less likely and that the systemic spread of infection 
is not accentuated during the bouts of reaction.

CD1-positive epidermal Langerhans cells in skin reactions to autologous 
peripheral-blood-derived mononuclear cells in leprosy patients.

Narayanan RB(1), Natarajan M, Katoch K, Sengupta U.

Author information:
(1)Central Jalma Institute for Leprosy (ICMR), Agra, India.

A comparison was made on the characteristics of the infiltrates, the number and 
distribution of CD1-positive epidermal Langerhans cells (LC) at the sites of 
skin reaction induced by autologous peripheral-blood-derived mononuclear cells 
(PBMC) in leprosy patients. Clinically and histologically, the skin reaction was 
well expressed in tuberculoid patients as compared to lepromatous patients, 
erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) patients and contacts. The quantum of 
lymphocytes in the infiltrates was maximal in the tuberculoid patients and it 
was minimal in lepromatous and ENL patients. The number and distribution of LC 
in the tuberculoid patients was significantly higher in the PBMC-inoculated 
sites as compared to control sites over 24 h. In contrast, no difference in the 
number and distribution of LC was noticed in the lepromatous and ENL patients. 
These observations indicate that the lymphocytes of tuberculoid patients in 
contrast to lepromatous leprosy patients are capable of sustenance in the local 
micro-environments of the skin and an effective interaction may be possible 
between LC and PBMC.

Renal functional status in leprosy.

Kanwar AJ, Bharija SC, Belhaj MS.

Renal functional status was evaluated in 27 patients with lepromatous leprosy. 
Renal functions were found to be significantly impaired in lepromatous patients 
with erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) in the active phases. Though patients in 
quiescent phases and uncomplicated lepromatous leprosy patients did show renal 
impairment, however, the degree of impairment in such cases was less than that 
in the reactive cases.

Ultrathin sections of the peripheral nerves taken from three lepromatous leprosy 
patients (One untreated, other treated and third in ENL reaction) was examined 
in the electronmicroscope. In the untreated patient, solid M. leprae organism 
inside the schwann cell and the degeneration of schwann cell was seen. In 
contrast, the treated patient showed the degeneration of bacilli and myelinated 
fibres. However, the characteristics of cells in the ENL reaction showed close 
similarities with the untreated case.

Saudi Arabia.

A 17-year-old, Yemeni male patient with borderline lepromatous leprosy and 
erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) developed a nephritic range proteinuria. A renal 
biopsy revealed mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis and epithelioid 
granulomas in the interstitium. The presence of granular immunofluorescence for 
C3 and electron-dense deposits in the glomeruli indicated an immune complex 
glomerulonephritis. Clinical signs of ENL subsided rapidly under steroid 
treatment. The unusual combination of proliferative glomerulonephritis and 
epithelioid granulomas in leprosy is presented and discussed.

Serum zinc/copper ratio in subtypes of leprosy and effect of oral zinc therapy 
on reactional states.

Author information:
(1)Department of Biochemistry, Central Leprosy Teaching and Research Institute, 
Chengalpattu, Tamil Nadu, India.

Serum zinc and copper levels and zinc/copper ratios were studied in 86 healthy 
controls, 45 cases of borderline tuberculoid (BT), 31 cases of borderline 
lepromatous (BL), 117 cases of lepromatous (LL) leprosy patients, 16 cases with 
severe erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) reaction, and 16 cases with ENL reaction 
receiving oral zinc therapy. A significant reduction in serum zinc levels was 
noticed in all types of leprosy, the maximum decrease being seen in cases with 
ENL reaction. Conversely, the copper levels were significantly increased from BT 
to LL cases with ENL reaction in a progressive manner. A very good negative 
correlation (r = -0.998) was noticed between mean serum zinc and copper levels 
from healthy controls to active LL cases with ENL reaction. After oral zinc 
therapy, the serum zinc levels were significantly increased in all of the 16 LL 
patients with ENL reaction. In contrast, the copper levels were not decreased, 
indicating that oral zinc therapy can restore normal zinc levels in leprosy 
patients but is unable to reduce the increased copper levels.

ConA-induced suppressor cells in lepromatous leprosy patients during and after 
erythema nodosum leprosum.

Sasiain MC, Ruibal Ares B, Baliña LM, Valdez R, Bachmann AE.

ConA-induced suppressor activity in patients with lepromatous leprosy (LL) was 
studied. Patients were studied during and after erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) 
reactions. The study included 16 patients with ENL, nine of whom returned once 
the ENL episode was over. Patients were compared to 12 normal controls. 
Suppressor activity was evaluated in vitro by cultivating peripheral blood 
lymphocytes (PBL) with an inducer of T suppressor cells, concanavalin A (ConA), 
and with two different mitogens, phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and ConA, in order to 
measure the inhibition of the proliferative responses in all cases. In contrast, 
in LL patients during ENL the ConA-induced suppressor response was markedly 
reduced. The reduction in suppressor responses was even more marked in the LL 
patients after the ENL episode. Reduced levels of suppressor activity in LL 
patients reveal a defect in central mechanisms of control in the immune 
response.

Effect of one year clofazimine therapy on autonomic functions in lepromatous 
leprosy with lepra (ENL) reaction.

Burte NP, Chandorkar AG, Muley MP, Balsara JJ, Bulakh PM.

Twenty patients of either sex of Lepromatous leprosy with frequent type II (ENL) 
reactions were selected for the study after exclusion of autonomic disorders. 
ANS functions were evaluated before and after Clofazimine therapy at an interval 
of two months for one year. Sweat function test, valsalva manoeuvre, Histamine 
triple response, cold pressor test and Homatropine instillation were carried out 
in twenty normal healthy volunteers (controls) and the (ENL) patients. 
Clofazimine was administered initially 100 mg three times daily for one month 
and then gradually reduced to a dose of 100 mg biweekly for the last three 
months. Before the clofazimine therapy, eighteen patients had abnormal sweat 
functions, five patients had abnormal valsalva score, five patients had abnormal 
cold pressor response and all the eighteen patients had abnormal histamine 
triple response test. Homatropine instillation test was normal in all the 
patients. ANS functions did not improve significantly with Clofazimine therapy, 
except in one patients with abnormal cold pressor response who showed slight 
improvement in pressor response which, however, did not reach the normal value. 
ANS function tests indicate complete involvement of local axon reflex and 
hyporeactivity of sympathetic system and cardiac regulatory mechanisms in these 
patients. Parasympathetic system seems to be normal as seen from Homatropine 
instillation test.

Apart from vague statements and speculative remarks, the role of ENL in the oral 
cavity has not been considered in the recent English language literature. A case 
of oral ENL is reported, and we postulate that ENL plays a prominent role in the 
intra-oral destruction noted in leprosy. Information gathered from the 
literature and from our own experience with a series of 37 leprosy patients with 
oral lesions support this postulation.

Numerical changes in T cell subsets (T gamma and T mu) in leprosy patients.

Izumi S, Sugiyama K, Matsumoto Y, Nagai T.

Eighty-six leprosy patients (49 active lepromatous, 24 inactive lepromatous 7 
borderline, and 6 tuberculoid) and nine healthy controls were examined for 
numerical changes in T cell subsets (T gamma and T mu), and complement levels in 
peripheral blood to determine the roles of T cell subsets and complement in the 
etiology of leprosy. The percentage and number of T gamma and T mu showed no 
significant differences among the different clinical groups, but 4 out of 49 
active lepromatous, 3 out of 24 inactive lepromatous and 3 out of 7 borderline 
cases showed a high prcentage of T gamma cells. Serum concentrations of C4, C3c, 
and C3 activator, an important factor in the alternative pathway of complement 
activation, were not significantly different among the groups. However, C3 
activator and C3c concentrations were significantly high in active lepromatous 
patients complicated by an immune complex disease called "erythema nodosum 
leprosum" (ENL) compared with ENL-free active lepromatous leprosy.

OBJECTIVE: To observe effects of phytoestrogens quercetin (QC), Genistein (GEN), 
coumestrol (COM), and enterolactone (ENL) on gap junctional intercellular 
communication (GJIC) in HaCaT cells.
METHODS: HaCaT cells were exposed to QC, GEN, COM, and ENL at 0.1, 1.0, 10.0 and 
100.0 micromol/L for 24 hours. The effects of phytoestrogens on GJIC were 
determined by fluorescence redistribution after photobleaching (FRAP) technique 
of using a laser scanning confocal microscope (LSCM).
RESULTS: QC did not affect the GJIC at 0.1-10.0 micromol/L, whereas, GEN, COM, 
and ENL exhibited inhibition on the GJIC in some extent at 0.1-10.0 micromol/L 
without showing significant cytotoxicity. The ratio of fluorescence recovery 
were between 31.77% to 37.06%, which were significantly decreased compared the 
vehicle control (44.74%).
CONCLUSION: The phytoestrogens GEN, COM, and ENL, but not QC, could inhibit the 
GJIC function in HaCaT cells at concentrations could be reached in human serum 
in some instance, indicating they could, under certain conditions, be cancer 
promoters. Therefore, it should be prudent to use these chemicals as 
pharmaceuticals or dietary supplements.

Histochemical study of Erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) lesions.

Abalos RM, Tolentino JG, Bustillo CC.

A histochemical study of ENL lesions was performed on skin biopsies from 14 
leproma-tous patients. There was: 1) the presence of moderate amounts of PAS 
positive diastase resistant materials, acid mucopolysaccharide, neutral fat, 
phospholipid, aryl sulfatase and acid phosphatase in areas around and away from 
reactional sites; 2) the presence of slight amounts or complete absence of these 
materials within areas of acute inflammation. These changes were interpreted as 
the result of solubilization and leakage of hydrolytic enzymes into the 
surrounding tissue. A possible role of lysosomal enzymes in the pathogenesis of 
ENL lesions is discussed.

A study of patients with erythema nondosum leprosum syndrome.

Dutta RK.

25 cases of Erythema Nodosum Leprosum (ENL) Syndrome have been clinically 
evaluated. Majority patients (84%) were males in the middle age group. Fever 
(56%), arthralgia (100%) and neuritic pains (100%) were common presenting 
constitutional symptoms. ENL was not related to DDS therapy or to any 
precipitating factors. Severity of reaction graded by clinical scoring was well 
correlated with fibrinolytic activity. Fibrinolytic activity was found decreased 
in all the cases. The decreases in fibrinolytic activity was more so pronounced 
in patients having higher clinical scorings.

Immunological methods employed in an attempt to induce erythema nodosum leprosum 
(ENL) in mice.

Anthony J, Vaidya MC, Dasgupta A.

In the mouse foot pad model five different parameters were employed to simulate 
the condition of ENL as observed in the human. The experimental groups with five 
to six months leprosy infection were injected intravenously with various 
anti-mycobacterial antibodies, M. leprae sonicate and 'B' cells obtained from 
syngenic donors. The control group of animals, infected similarly, were treated 
either with M. leprae sonicate or gamma globulins precipitated from normal human 
serum. All recipients were killed at one day interval excepting those with 'B' 
cell transfer, which were sacrificed at seven days. The sites of predilection 
for immune complex deposition viz. foot pad and kidney as well as the spleen 
were examined by light and fluorescence microscopy. These findings are described 
and discussed.

Erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL). Ultrastructure of the connective tissue 
response.

Ridley MJ, Heather CJ, Ridley DS.

In ENL lesions of the type associated with severe damage to the connective 
tissue of the dermis, large quantities of bacterial debris were demonstrated by 
electron microscopy, although not by light microscopy. The debris, in an 
advanced stage of degeneration, was present in the phagosomes of decrepit 
macrophages, in the extracellular compartment and, in particular, bound to 
degenerate collagen and elastic where immunoglobulin, complement, and 
inflammatory mediators had been demonstrated previously. It is suggested that 
the complexing of mycobacterial antigen is a major factor in the causation of 
connective tissue damage, as well as other aspects of ENL. The reason why 
connective tissue involvement is so variable has not been explained.

Immunological assessment of sera of leprosy patients.

Sengupta U, Sinha S, Ramu G.

IgG levels were significantly high in sera of all types of leprosy. House-hold 
contacts of lepromatous leprosy (LL) cases also showed significantly higher 
values for IgG when compared to that of control. Except polar tuberculoid (TT) 
cases and house-hold contacts other types of leprosy revealed a significant rise 
in IgA levels in their sera. IgM was only raised in borderline tuberculoid (BT) 
cases. C-reactive protein (CRP) was present in the sera of all types of leprosy. 
Highest positivity (97%) was shown by sera from erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) 
cases. Rose-Waaler antibody (RA) was noted in BT, borderline leprosy (BL), LL 
and ENL cases. Significance of these findings is discussed.

The production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) by Mycobacterium leprae-stimulated 
phagocyte cells, isolated from lepromatous leprosy patients (LL) and normal 
individuals, was evaluated, using the highly TNF-sensitive mouse fibrosarcoma 
cell line WEHI164cl13. Mononuclear cells, isolated from all individuals studied, 
showed a low level of spontaneous TNF production, except for patients undergoing 
erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL), in which we found significantly higher levels 
of TNF. Addition of M. leprae to the phagocyte cell culture enhanced TNF 
production in all groups studied, except in the group with untreated leprosy 
patients. Strongest M. leprae-induced TNF release was found in mononuclear cell 
cultures derived from ENL patients. Patients in the postreactional state showed 
significantly higher TNF levels than healthy controls. These findings support 
the idea that TNF plays a key role in the complex symptomatology of ENL.

Nerve abscess in lepromatous leprosy. A case report and a discussion of 
pathogenesis.

Choudhury SB, Srinivasan H.

An instance of nerve abscesses developing in a patient with lepromatous leprosy 
is reported. The pathogenesis of nerve abscess in lepromatous leprosy is briefly 
discussed. It appears that such abscesses may develop (i) from an ENL lesion in 
the nerve during ENL reaction, (ii) because of exacerbation of existing 
lepromatous lesion, (iii) arise as an "exacerbation nodule", (iv) due to quiet 
necrosis in a lepromatous granuloma, or (v) it may be iatrogenic.

Single-step electrochemical nanolithography of metal thin films by localized 
etching with an AFM tip.

(1)Physique de la Matière Condensée, Ecole Polytechnique, CNRS, F-91128 
Palaiseau, France.

This work introduces electrochemical nanolithography (ENL), a single-step method 
in which a metal thin film is locally etched without application of a mask on a 
100 nm length scale with an electrochemical atomic force microscope (AFM). The 
method requires the application of ultra-short voltage pulses on the tip 
(nanosecond range duration, 2-4 V amplitude), while both the sample and the 
metalized tip are under independent potentiostatic control for full control of 
interface reactions in an AFM electrochemical cell. It is demonstrated that Cu 
films as well as Co and Cu/Co sandwich magnetic films can be patterned if 
negative voltage pulses are applied to the tip. This method also applies to 
films deposited on an insulating substrate. Moreover the lateral dimension of 
lithographed structures is tunable, from a few micrometers down to 150 nm, by 
appropriate choice of ENL conditions. Simulation of the dissolution process is 
discussed.

A study of antispermatozoal antibodies in leprosy.

Gupta SC, Chhabra B, Mehrotra TN, Bajaj AK.

Sixty male patients with polar leprosy (33 lepromatous and 27 tuberculoid) were 
studied for the presence of antispermatozoal antibodies. Antibodies were 
detected by three different immunological tests. The sperm immobilization test 
was found to be the most sensitive. In lepromatous leprosy the incidence of 
these antibodies was higher than in tuberculoid cases. An increasing incidence 
of antispermatozoal antibodies was observed with the duration of the disease 
irrespective of the test employed for their detection. No correlation between 
the number of erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) reactions and the incidence of 
antibodies could be demonstrated.

[HLA and leprosy in Dakar: distribution of histocompatibility antigens in

[Article in French]

Blavy G, Thiam D, Ndoye B, Diakhate L, Millan J.

50 lepromatous patients among whom 34 shared repeating ENL reactions and a 
reference group of 150 blood donors were typed for HLA antigens. In the 
comparison of the lepromatous group to the reference group, the HLA-B 8 was the 
only antigen which turned out to be significantly increased within the 
lepromatous patients. Some changes reported by other authors have also been 
pointed out (decrease in HLA-A2 and HLA-A3, increase in HLA-AW 23 within the 
lepromatous patients) but those are not significant in this study. In the 
lepromatous group itself, not any significant change has been pointed out 
between the patients sharing ENL and those who did not show any. Nevertheless a 
non-significant increase in HLA-BW 35 in the patients with ENL is to be pointed 
out.

Author information:
(1)Department of Ophthalmology, Schieffelin Leprosy Research and Training 
Center, Karigiri, Tamil Nadu, India.

The pupil cycle time (PCT) was estimated in 384 leprosy patients whose eyes 
looked normal on clinical examination and in an equal number of healthy 
controls. A statistically significant increase in PCT (p < 0.05) was noticed in 
leprosy patients, and corroborates the view that the ocular autonomic system may 
be affected without any visible clinical pathology in the eye. The clinical 
value and application of this finding is uncertain since the difference is only 
a few milliseconds. Young females with leprosy showed a conspicuous lengthening 
of PCT for which no plausible explanation is offered. There was a general trend 
for the PCT to increase as the spectrum of disease moved toward the lepromatous 
pole and a significantly higher PCT (p < 0.01) was found among multibacillary 
patients compared to paucibacillary patients. Patients who had had erythema 
nodosum leprosum (ENL) reactions showed a higher PCT than did those who had not 
had ENL. Patients who had had reversal reactions showed a decrease in PCT, which 
may be a statistical oddity in this hospital-based study. Patients whose 
duration of the disease was over 10 years showed a higher PCT, while smear 
positivity of a patient did not alter the PCT significantly.

[Cell mediated immune response in leprosy lesions].

[Article in Japanese]

Fujita M, Miyachi Y, Izumi S, Imamura S.

Five biopsies from 2 leprosy patients, tuberculoid (TT), and polar lepromatous 
(LLp), were studies using immunoperoxidase procedures with monoclonal 
antibodies. Immunohistochemical patterns of them were remarkably different. In a 
TT patient, epithelioid cells and helper/inducer T (Leu 3a+) cells made the 
central core of a granuloma surrounded by suppressor/cytotoxic T (T8+) cells and 
B cells, indicating a possible immune-mediated cell response. The distribution 
of B cells suggests that not only T but also B cells may take part in the 
formation of the granuloma. In contrast, helper/inducer cells, 
suppressor/cytotoxic cells, and macrophages of a LLp patient were admixed 
uniformly at the site of the lesion, indicating a poor immune response. Although 
the ENL skin lesion of this LLp patient did not eliminate the bacilli, HLA-DR 
expression by keratinocytes and increased numbers of helper/inducer cells found 
in an ENL lesion, comparable to the findings of TT leprosy, suggests that a cell 
mediated immune response may play some role in the pathogenesis of ENL reaction.

Imbalances in T cell subpopulations in lepromatous leprosy.

Wallach D, Cottenot F, Bach MA.

Circulating T cells, T helper, and T suppressor cells were investigated in 24 
lepromatous patients, using murine hybridoma-derived monoclonal antibodies OKT 
3, OKT 4, and OKT 8. Six bacillary lepromatous patients without recent eNL were 
studied; in this group, suppressor cells were increased and helper cells 
diminished, resulting in a decrease in the helper/suppressor (H/S) ratio. Nine 
bacteriologically negative lepromatous patients without recent ENL were studied. 
T cell subsets distribution was normal, although some T cell functions were 
affected. It was further shown that in non-ENL patients, the diminution of the 
H/S ratio is correlated with the Bacteriologic Index (BI). Although bacillary, 
ENL patients exhibit a completely different T cell pattern than non-reactional 
patients. In these patients, there was a significant diminution of circulating 
suppressor cells, and an increase in T cell functions. These abnormalities were 
transient. Our results confirm the importance of suppressor cells in lepromatous 
leprosy, and suggest that imbalance between helper and suppressor cells may play 
a role in the pathogenesis of ENL reactions.

IgM antibodies against phenolic glycolipid I from Mycobacterium leprae in 
leprosy sera: relationship to bacterial index and erythema nodosum leprosum.

Schwerer B, Meeker HC, Sersen G, Levis WR.

Serum IgM antibodies against Mycobacterium leprae-derived phenolic glycolipid I 
(PG) were determined in 121 leprosy patients, in contacts and controls by an 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique. Anti-PG IgM levels correlated with 
disease classification, increasing from the tuberculoid towards the lepromatous 
pole of the disease spectrum. There was a linear correlation between serum IgM 
PG-antibody levels and bacillary index (BI), a measure of bacterial load. 
Elevated anti-PG IgM in bacillary negative patients was usually indicative of 
active disease, undetected by BI. We conclude that anti-PG IgM levels are 
valuable for monitoring the degree of disease activity. Serum anti-PG IgM levels 
were significantly lower in patients with erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) as 
compared to those without ENL, suggesting that IgM PG-antibodies are also 
involved in the pathogenesis of ENL.

A study of serum fibrinolytic activity in erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL).

Jain VK, Verma KC, Aggarwal SS.

Fibrinolytic activity was studied in 31 patients of leprosy and 10 healthy 
controls. Fibrinolytic activity was found to be significantly decreased in 
patients with erythema nodosum leprosum, compared to those with uncomplicated 
lepromatous leprosy, who in turn showed lowered activity compared to patients 
with tuberculoid form of leprosy and controls. The severity of ENL correlated 
very well with decrease in fibrinolytic activity. Fibrinolytic activity was 
improved to levels obtained in uncomplicated lepromatous leprosy after the 
subsidence of reaction. So it would seem reasonable to suggest that estimation 
of fibrinolytic activity provides a reliable criteria to quantitate the severity 
of erythema nodosum leprosum.

Leprosy XII. Quantitative analysis of thymus-derived lymphocyte response to 
phytohemagglutinin in leprosy.

Lim SD, Jacobson RR, Park BH, Good RA.

The immune status of various leprosy patients was evaluated by using a 
micromethod to evaluate lymphocyte responses to phytohemagglutinin (PHA). In our 
study, whole blood was used and the degree of response to PHA stimulation was 
expressed in terms of unit volume of blood. A markedly decreased response to PHA 
stimulation was noted in patients with active lepromatous leprosy. Patients with 
active lepromatous leprosy who have been proved drug (DDS) resistant showed less 
response than did those of drug sensitive patients with active lepromatous 
disease, while the patients with active lepromatous leprosy complicated by 
erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) showed higher response than did those of 
patients with no complicated ENL. Comparing the results obtained to those 
obtained using other methods for T cell analysis indicates that these results 
reflect the number of T lymphocytes in the leprosy patient. Thus, this simple 
method is of value in assaying the presence and responses of T lymphocytes in 
the leprosy patient.

Tissue and blood T-lymphocyte subpopulations in erythema nodosum leprosum.

Modlin RL, Bakke AC, Vaccaro SA, Horwitz DA, Taylor CR, Rea TH.

To study T lymphocytes in erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL), monoclonal antibodies 
were used to identify T-lymphocyte subpopulations in the blood and skin lesions 
of patients with ENL and patients with nonreactional lepromatous leprosy. The 
blood of nonreactional lepromatous patients had a lymphopenia and a 
proportionate reduction in pan T cells, helper-inducer, and suppressor-cytotoxic 
subsets, but a normal helper-suppressor ratio, as compared with controls. 
Patients with ENL did not differ significantly from the controls. In skin 
lesions, an admixture of helper and suppressor phenotypes among foamy 
histiocytes was found. The ENL tissue had more numerous cells of the 
helper-inducer phenotype and fewer of the suppressor-cytotoxic phenotype, as 
compared with nonreaction lepromatous tissues. In 22 patients with simultaneous 
examination of tissue and blood T-cell subsets, there was no correlation between 
tissue and blood helper-suppressor ratios, indicating that some sort of 
selection process brings lymphocytes into tissues from peripheral blood.

Thalidomide--effect on T cell subsets as a possible mechanism of action.

Moncada B, Baranda ML, González-Amaro R, Urbina R, Loredo CE.

Thalidomide is the drug of choice in the erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) type of 
lepra reaction. Lately it has been used successfully in other diseases, such as 
discoid lupus erythematosus, actinic prurigo, Behcet's disease, etc. However, 
its mechanism of action remains unknown. In patients for whom thalidomide 
provided relief in their disorder, the proportions of T lymphocytes and their 
subsets in peripheral blood were assessed by means of monoclonal antibodies. 
Three lepromatous leprosy patients with ENL had their T helper populations 
significantly increased after thalidomide therapy. A 14-year-old girl with 
Behcet's syndrome showed a consistent decrease in Ia+ cells throughout her 
three-month course of thalidomide therapy. The same findings were observed in 
two patients with the actinic prurigo type of polymorphous light eruption. From 
these results, we conclude that thalidomide may act as an immunomodulating agent 
on T cell subsets.

(1)Department of Experimental Medicine, Postgraduate Institute of Medical 
Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.

Serum samples were collected from eighty-three leprosy patients and twenty-five 
healthy controls supposedly not exposed to Mycobacterium leprae infection. 
Phenolic glycolipid-1 coated latex agglutination test (PGL-LAT) was carried out 
with the serum samples to detect antibodies specific to M. leprae. Samples 
showing positive agglutination were 50% in the lepromatous leprosy (LL) group 
showing no erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) complications, 66.6% in LL group with 
ENL complication, 60% in borderline lepromatous (BL) group, 50% in borderline 
(BB) and 33.3% in borderline tuberculoid (BT). The patients belonging to the 
tuberculoid (TT) group and most of the long-term treated patients were 
interestingly negative, and so were sera from all the healthy controls. PGL-LAT 
developed by us therefore is specific and a fairly sensitive technique to detect 
antibodies specific to M. leprae and will be very useful in field conditions.

A retrospective study of 256 reactional episodes, both reversal reaction and 
erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL), seen in Buluba Hospital over a 5-year period 
(1985-89) was made. Over 90% of these episodes were due to reversal reaction, 
with ENL being encountered infrequently. About 80% of reversal reactions 
occurred during chemotherapy but all the episodes of ENL occurred during this 
period. Over 70% of both reversal and ENL episodes presented with clinically 
apparent nerve and skin involvement. The need to assess the effect of multidrug 
therapy on the incidence of reactions and to develop more sensitive diagnostic 
tools to detect early neuritis is emphasized. It is also necessary to study 
those patients who develop recurrent reactional episodes.

A case of lepromatous leprosy with erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) presenting as 
a myeloid leukemoid reaction is reported. Very high leucocyte count with 
immaturity of the cells in myeloid series was present in peripheral blood. High 
leucocyte alkaline phosphatase score, absence of hepatosplenomegaly and 
transient nature of leukemoid reaction differentiated it from chronic myeloid 
leukemia and acute myeloblastic leukemia. The possible mechanisms of leukemoid 
reaction in ENL are discussed.

Thymus dependent lymphocytes in leprosy. I. T lymphocyte subpopulations defined 
by monoclonal antibodies.

Mshana RN, Haregewoin A, Harboe M, Belehu A.

Monoclonal antibodies recognizing different human T lymphocyte subpopulations 
were used to characterize peripheral blood T lymphocytes in patients with 
leprosy. An increase in the suppressor T lymphocyte subpopulation was seen only 
in lepromatous leprosy (BL-LL) patients. In contrast, patients who had erythema 
nodosum leprosum (ENL) showed a disturbance in immunoregulation seen as a 
decrease of the suppressor cell percentage and manifested by an increase in in 
vitro lymphoproliferative responses to both PPD and PHA. This imbalance was seen 
to normalize as patients improved clinically. There was no deviation from the 
normal values of the total T lymphocyte population. It is suggested, therefore, 
that ENL may be associated with an acute imbalance of T lymphocyte 
subpopulations. Since the suppressor T lymphocyte identified by the mononuclear 
antibody used is antigen nonspecific, the significance of these suppressor cells 
in the pathogenesis of leprosy remains unclear.

Reversal reaction in patients with lepromatous leprosy after transplantation of 
human fetal thymic grafts.

Saha K, Dutta RN, Dutta AK, Mohan TK.

An attempt has been made to reconstitute impaired cell-mediated immunity in 1 
patient with indeterminate, 4 patients with borderline and 2 patients with polar 
lepromatous leprosy by grafting three thymus glands obtained from human fetuses 
of 14--19 weeks gestation. Most of these patients had severe ulcerative erythema 
nodosum leprosum (ENL) and were intolerant to dapsone. After thymus 
transplantation these patients were followed for 1 1/2 years. During this 
period, all conventional chemotherapy had been withdrawn. In most cases, there 
was dramatic improvement of the clinical condition, resolution of skin lesions, 
subsidence of ENL, clearance of bacteria from skin and reconstitution of several 
immunologic deficits; but late lepromin reactivity returned in none, which 
indicated permanent lose of resistance to Mycobacterium leprae.

The effect of circulating immune complexes, isolated in the form of polyethylene 
glycol (PEG) precipitates from leprosy patients, on lymphocyte proliferation was 
studied. The results obtained showed that PEG precipitates obtained from the 
borderline lepromatous/lepromatous (BL/LL) types of leprosy patients and those 
undergoing erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) had significant suppressive effects 
on the lymphocyte proliferation induced by Mycobacterium leprae antigens in 
healthy responders. The percent decreases in the mean values of delta cpm in the 
presence of PEG precipitates from the BL/LL and ENL groups were found to be 46.8 
+/- 22.4 and 65.0 +/- 24.3, respectively. However, no significant suppressive 
effects (except for ENL PEG precipitates) of these PEG precipitates were 
observed on the lymphocyte proliferation induced by tuberculin (PPD). Further, 
PEG precipitates alone (in the absence of M. leprae antigen) from the BL/LL and 
ENL groups were found to have no effect on the lymphocyte proliferation.

A trial of long-acting sulphonamide R.O. 4-4393 (fanasil) in treatment of cases 
of lepromatous leprosy with repeated E.N.L.

Ekambaram V, Venkatachari S.

A trial of long-acting Sulphonamide RO.4-4393 (Fanasil) in the treatment of 
Lepromatous Leprosy patients with repeated E.N.L. is reported in this paper. 
There were 9 patients treated with Fanasil in this trial for a period of 2 
years. The results of the trial have shown that the treatment with Fanasil helps 
to prevent the occurrence of E.N.L. under treatment with D.D.S. In addition, 
even after the completion of treatment with Fanasil, these patients seem to be 
stabilised and are able to tolerate D.D.S. But, the clinical and Bacteriological 
progress under Fanasil therapy is not satisfactory.

Natural emergence of antigen-reactive T cells in lepromatous leprosy patients 
during erythema nodosum leprosum.

Laal S, Bhutani LK, Nath I.

Fifteen lepromatous leprosy (LL) patients undergoing erythema nodosum leprosum 
(ENL) reactions were compared with 13 stable, uncomplicated, anergic individuals 
of the same leprosy background. ENL patients showed significant antigen-induced 
leukocyte migration inhibition (migration index = 0.058 +/- 0.01), paralleling 
the values obtained with a responder tuberculoid leprosy population (migration 
index = 0.04 +/- 0.004). Both phytohemagglutinin-induced general T-cell 
proliferation and, more significantly, antigen-induced lymphoproliferation were 
enhanced during the acute phase of the reaction. Suppressor cell activity, 
monitored by a costimulant assay, showed enhanced antigen-stimulated suppression 
of mitogen responses. Interestingly, the improvement in in vitro T-cell 
responses was not reflected in dermal reactivity, since 48-h delayed-type 
hypersensitivity responses after intradermal injection of soluble Mycobacterium 
leprae antigens continued to be poor. After subsidence of reactional lesions, 
leukocyte migration inhibition, lymphoproliferation, and suppressor cell 
activity were reduced to the unresponsive state seen in stable LL patients. 
Significantly, perturbations of T-cell reactivity are detectable in ENL 
reactions, indicating the natural but transient emergence of antigen-induced T 
cells in LL.

Evaluation of Acute Phase Reactants As Indicators of Activity in Leprosy.

Jain AP, Gupta OP, Jajoo UN, Kumar K.

Acute phase reactants i. e. ESR, C-reactive proteins, alpha 1 antitrypsin, 
complement (C3) and circulation immune complexes were evaluated in relation with 
the activity of the disease in leprosy. Levels of all the acute phase reactants 
were significantly raised during the active plase (LL and ENL), while these were 
normal during the arrested phase of the disease. Appearance of, circulating 
immune complexes also followed the same pattern. It is concluded that raised 
levels of ESR (C-reactive proteins, alpha-1 antitrypsin, complement (C3) and 
circulating immune complexes suggest active phase (LL ENL) of the disease in 
leprosy.

Defect in the generation of cytotoxic T cells in lepromatous leprosy.

Cytotoxic T cells are consistently produced in normal individuals after in vitro 
stimulation by a pool of mitomycin-treated normal lymphocytes. Patients 
suffering from lepromatous leprosy (LL), presenting with large amounts of 
Mycobacterium leprae and without a history of erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) 
are unable to generate such cytotoxic T cells, while lepromatous patients with 
ENL which, in the present study were all deprived of M. leprae, react normally.

Twenty erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) patients were examined. Coagulation 
studies were carried out in 13 of them during their active stage and 7 in the 
latent stage. From these 13 patients, 6 were re-examined when the disease became 
latent. From these observations a conclusion can be drawn that there are 
coagulation abnormalities in the majority of ENL patients in the active stage 
and these abnormalities will return to normal values when the disease becomes 
latent.

Serum immunoglobulin profile and C3 level in lepromatous leprosy patients.

Harikrishan S, Balakrishnan S, Bhatia VN.

A study of the serum levels of IgA, IgG, IgM and C3 in well defined cases of 
lepromatous leprosy has been undertaken. The serum levels of IgA, IgG and IgM 
were significantly raised in the group of lepromatous leprosy patients (20) 
compared to healthy controls (20). The C3 level also tends to be increased in 
these patients. In the 15 cases of LL, studied before and after ENL reaction, 
the levels of all the immunoglobulins as well as C3 were found to be further 
increased during ENL and showed a fall during subsidence.

A controlled study was mounted to assess the possible benefit of a single phlebo 
administration of 600 mg lincomycin 1 hr prior to colon surgery, in addition to 
the erythromycin + neomycin combination proposed by Nichols, as a means of 
constituting a further pharmacological barrier to the spread of anaerobic 
bacteria. The study currently comprises two groups of 15 patients fully 
comparable with regard to pathology distribution and randomly assigned to the 
E.N. and the E.N.L. protocol respectively. Six instances of septic complication 
have been observed, five in the group prepared with E.N. and 1 prepared with 
E.N.L. No significance can be attached to the different incidence of 
complications in the two arms of the study, owing to the small number of cases 
examined.

The difference in urinary excretion of mammalian and plant lignans in rats was 
determined after oral administration of equivalent doses (25 mg/kg of body 
weight) of 7-hydroxymatairesinol (HMR), lariciresinol (LAR), matairesinol (MR), 
and secoisolariciresinol (SECO). Twenty-four hours-urine samples were collected 
after a single dose and after administration of one dose/day for 10 days. Eight 
lignans were analysed in urine extracts using a high-performance liquid 
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method showing good sensitivity and 
repeatability. After a single dose of HMR, LAR, MR, and SECO, the main 
metabolites were 7-hydroxyenterolactone (HENL), cyclolariciresinol (CLAR), 
enterolactone (ENL), and enterodiol (END), respectively, but after 10-day 
exposure ENL was the main metabolite of all the tested lignans, showing a 
considerably higher excretion than after a single dose. Metabolic 
transformations of plant lignans into each other could also be observed.

erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) received six capsules containing either 100 mg 
(group A, n = 12) or 300 mg (group B, n = 10) of thalidomide daily for one week. 
A six-week, four capsules per day taper followed, in which group A received 50 
mg/day of thalidomide in weeks 2 and 3, then dummy capsules in weeks 4 through 
7, while group B had gradual decrements every two weeks. Both regimens caused 
comparable improvement in 19 patients at day 7 (group A [12 of 12] versus group 
B [7 of 10]; P = 0.08), but slower tapering in group B showed less re-emergence 
of ENL through week 7 (P = 0.02, versus group A). Most patients developed new 
lesions soon after stopping treatment. Slower tapering from a higher initial 
thalidomide dose may improve clinical ENL responses, but high recurrence rates 
after discontinuation indicates further assessment is needed to identify better 
tapering regimens.

Some leprosy patients suffer from clinical episodes associated with tissue 
damage which are designated as Type 1 (reversal reaction) when localized to the 
lesions and Type 2 (erythema nodosum leprosum, ENL) when accompanied by systemic 
involvement. We had reported earlier that stable, non-reaction lepromatous 
leprosy subjects show T helper 2 (Th2)- and Th0- but not Th1-like responses in 
the peripheral blood. To further understand the development of Th-like responses 
during disease, 32 lepromatous patients undergoing reactions were studied using 
cytokine-specific reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in peripheral blood and some skin 
biopsies. Of interest was the evidence of a Th1-like response with presence of 
interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and absence of interleukin-4 (IL-4) mRNA in the 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of 85 and 64% of Type 1 and 2 reaction 
patients, respectively, and in all reaction sites. Whereas a Th0- was seen in 
some, a Th2-like response was absent. IL-12p40 mRNA was seen in 21/25 ENL and 
all Type 1 reaction subjects irrespective of the Th phenotype. IL-12p40 and 
IFN-gamma were detectable in unstimulated PBMC suggesting an in vivo priming 
during reactions. IL-10 was mainly associated with adherent cells and showed a 
differential expression in the two reactions. It was present in the PBMC of ENL 
but not in reversal reaction patients. Moreover, it was not detectable in the 
skin lesions of either type of reactions. A Th1-like cytokine profile was 
associated with immunopathology and persisted up to 6-7 months after the onset 
of reactions.

Reactional states in leprosy are produced by different immunologic mechanisms 
and are responsible for a major component of tissue damage of the disease. 
Reversal reactions exhibit increased CD4 T cell infiltration in lesions and 
augmented cell-mediated immune reactivity to Ag of Mycobacterium leprae that can 
rapidly produce nerve damage. Erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) reactions also 
have CD4 T cell infiltration but appear to be associated with the formation of 
immune complexes that are responsible for panniculitis, arthritis, vasculitis, 
and nerve injury. Because these reactional states may serve as paradigms for 
other types of human immunologically mediated tissue damage, this study sought 
to characterize the dynamic changes in cytokines associated with these 
reactions. Expression of cytokine mRNA in lesions of leprosy reactional states 
were measured by PCR. In reversal reactions, IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, IL-2, and 
IFN-gamma mRNA were prominent and found to increase during the reaction, 
concomitant with decreases in expression of mRNA for IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10. In 
ENL, selective increases in the expression of IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 mRNA was 
observed, with persistent expression of IL-4 and IL-5 mRNA. Reversal reactions 
represent naturally occurring delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions that favor 
macrophage activation and protective immunity, but which can engender 
concomitant cell injury. In contrast, ENL lesions represent immediate-type 
hypersensitivity reactions reflecting the selective stimulation of cytokines 
that attract neutrophils, stimulate antibody production, and down-regulate 
macrophage activation. The analysis of cytokine dynamics within different 
inflammatory responses can provide insights into immune mechanisms of tissue 
damage, and provide a useful framework for developing strategies for therapeutic 
intervention.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Rheumatic manifestations are a common feature of leprosy. 
The present study was performed to assess the incidence of rheumatic 
manifestations in leprosy.
METHODS: Seventy cases of leprosy attending the indoor and outdoor departments 
were studied.
RESULTS: Out of the 70 cases studied, rheumatic manifestations were seen in 
61.42% of cases: arthritis in 54.28% and soft tissue rheumatism in 17.14%. 
Enthesitis was seen in 2.84% of cases. The incidence of arthritis in lepra 
reactions was 57.57%.
CONCLUSIONS: Musculoskeletal manifestations can occur at any time during the 
infection. Articular inflammation in leprosy usually occurs in reactive states, 
particularly erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL). Leprosy can present with arthritis 
as the first symptom.

Oral zinc in recurrent Erythema Nodosum Leprosum reaction.

Mathur NK, Bumb RA, Mangal HN.

Oral zinc sulfate was tried in Eight cases of recurrent Erythema Nodosum 
Leprosum. To control ENL, they required high dosage of clofazimine and steroids 
for prolonged periods. After instituting oral zinc, the dose of clofazimine 
could be reduced to 100 mg twice a week and steroids could be withdrawn 
completely. Four out of five patients who were not tolerating dapsone earlier, 
started tolerating dapsone. Incidence and severity of subsequent ENL was also 
reduced.

Renal functional status in lepromatous leprosy.

Bajaj AK, Gupta SC, Sinha SN, Govil DC, Gaur UC, Kumar R.

Renal functional status was evaluated in 122 patients with lepromatous leprosy. 
Renal functions were found to be markedly impaired in patients with erythema 
nodosum leprosum (ENL) in the active or quiescent phases. Although uncomplicated 
lepromatous leprosy patients did show significant renal impairment as compared 
to healthy controls, the degree of impairment was less than that of the reactive 
cases. Diminished endogenous creatinine clearance and proteinuria were the 
common abnormalities detected. Serum creatinine was significantly increased only 
in reactive cases. Blood urea was found to be marginally increased in a few 
patients although not to a statistically significant degree. Renal involvement 
did not bear any relation to the duration of illness or to the Bacteriological 
Index.

An AF9/ENL-targted peptide with therapeutic potential in mixed lineage 
leukemias.

Barretto NN, Karahalios DS, You D, Hemenway CS.

Misregulation of transcription elongation is proposed to underlie the 
pathobiology of MLL leukemia. AF4, AF9, and ENL, common MLL fusion partners, are 
found in complex with positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb). AF9 
and its homolog ENL directly interact with AF4 within these complexes. 
Previously, we designed a peptide that mimics the AF9 binding domain of AF4 and 
reported that MLL leukemia cell lines are inhibited by it. Extending these 
studies, we have modified the peptide design in order to avoid recognition by 
proteases. The peptide is as effective as its predecessor in vitro and enhances 
survival in mice bearing MLL leukemia cell lines.

Leprosy is usually well-controlled by multidrug therapy (MDT). However, in case 
of noncompliance or leprosy reactions, it may present a therapeutically 
challenge. A 33-year-old Brazilian woman with lepromatous leprosy was treated 
with MDT for one year, but then discontinued therapy because she wanted to have 
children. Eight weeks after stopping her medications, she developed a severe and 
recalcitrant erythema (nodosum) leprosum (ENL) which presented histologically 
with thrombosed small veins and neutrophilic inflammation in fat septa, but 
without arteritis. During her pregnancy and ensuing lactation period, 
glucocorticoids were the only suitable drug. With the use of the shortened 
WHO/MDT regimen (one year vs. two years of treatment), ENL will probably be seen 
more often after the end of leprosy therapy. It needs to be rapidly recognized 
and treated to avoid damage to eyes or kidneys.

Tissue distribution and elimination of sesaminol triglucoside and its 
metabolites in rat.

Jan KC(1), Hwang LS, Ho CT.

University, Taipei, Taiwan.

Sesame exhibits many beneficial physiological effects, which are mostly related 
to its lignan compounds, such as sesaminol glucosides. This investigation 
studies the distribution and elimination of sesaminol triglucoside from sesame 
in Sprague Dawley (SD) rats. In order to investigate the distribution of 
sesaminol triglucoside (p.o. 500 mg/kg) in SD rats, the changes in concentration 
of sesaminol triglucoside and its metabolites were determined in tissues and 
plasma within 24 h period after tube-feeding to SD rats. Results showed that 
sesaminol triglucoside may be deglycosylated to form sesaminol first by 
intestinal microflora and then incorporated via lymphatic absorption into the 
cardiovascular system, transported to other tissues. The concentrations of 
sesaminol triglucoside and its metabolites in rectum, caecum, colon, and small 
intestines are higher than those in liver, lung, kidney, and heart. Its 
concentration in brain is low but detectable. Glucuronidation and sulfation was 
the main metabolic pathway for sesaminol in urine, and fecal elimination was a 
major route of elimination. From LC/MS/MS analysis of rat organs, sesaminol 
triglucoside can be converted to mammalian lignans, enterodiol (END), and 
enterolactone (ENL), by rat intestinal microflora. In the plasma, concentrations 
of END and ENL were 5.9 +/- 0.2 and 5.5 +/- 0.2 micromol/mL, respectively.

The immunomodulatory drug thalidomide is the treatment of choice for erythema 
nodosum leprosum (ENL), an inflammatory cutaneous and systemic complication of 
multibacillary leprosy. To elucidate the mechanism of action of thalidomide in 
this syndrome, we prospectively investigated 20 patients with ENL who were 
treated with thalidomide for 21 days. All patients responded to treatment, with 
the majority of them having complete resolution of cutaneous lesions within 7 
days. This response was associated with a marked but transient increase in ex 
vivo mitogen-induced expression of interleukin (IL)-2 and interferon- gamma by 
CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells that was observed on treatment day 7, but these 
returned to pretreatment levels by day 21. Plasma tumor necrosis factor- alpha 
levels were not high at baseline, and they increased modestly during treatment. 
Plasma levels of IL-12 increased steadily during thalidomide treatment. Hence, 
the therapeutic effect of thalidomide in ENL appears to be associated with 
transient immune stimulation, which suggests that the drug may promote an active 
immunoregulatory response.

The potential for the extraction of the plant lignan hydroxymatairesinol (HMR) 
in large scale from Norway spruce (Picea abies) has given us the opportunity to 
study the metabolism and biological actions of HMR in animals. HMR, the most 
abundant single component of spruce lignans, was metabolized to enterolactone 
(ENL) as the major metabolite in rats after oral administration. The amounts of 
urinary ENL increased with the dose of HMR (from 3 to 50 mg/kg), and only minor 
amounts of unmetabolized HMR isomers and other lignans were found in urine. HMR 
(15 mg/kg body wt po) given for 51 days decreased the number of growing tumors 
and increased the proportion of regressing and stabilized tumors in the rat 
dimethylbenz[a]anthracene-induced mammary tumor model. HMR (50 mg/kg body wt) 
did not exert estrogenic or antiestrogenic activity in the uterine growth test 
in immature rats. HMR also showed no antiandrogenic responses in the growth of 
accessory sex glands in adult male rats. Neither ENL nor enterodiol showed 
estrogenic or antiestrogenic activity via a classical alpha- or beta-type 
estrogen receptor-mediated pathway in vitro at < 1.0 microM. HMR was an 
effective antioxidant in vitro.

BACKGROUND: Lignans in plant foods are metabolized by gut bacteria to the 
enterolignans, enterodiol (END) and enterolactone (ENL). Enterolignans have 
biologic activities important to the prevention of cancer and chronic diseases. 
We examined the composition of the gut microbial community (GMC) as a 
contributor to human enterolignan exposure.
METHODS: We evaluated the association between the GMC in stool, urinary 
enterolignan excretion, and diet from a 3-day food record in 115 premenopausal 
(ages 40-45 years) women in the United States. Urinary enterolignans were 
measured using gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy. The GMC was evaluated using 
454 pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. Sequences were aligned in SILVA 
(www.arb-silva.de). Operational taxonomic units were identified at 97% sequence 
similarity. Taxonomic classification was performed and alpha and beta diversity 
in relationship to ENL production were assessed. Multivariate analysis and 
regression were used to model the association between enterolignan excretion and 
the GMC. Bacteria associated with ENL production were identified using 
univariate analysis and ridge regression.
RESULTS: After adjusting for dietary fiber intake and adiposity, we found a 
significant positive association between ENL excretion and either the GMC (P = 
0.0007), or the diversity of the GMC (P = 0.01). The GMC associated with high 
ENL production was distinct (UNIFRAC, P < 0.003, MRPP) and enriched in Moryella 
spp., Acetanaerobacterium spp., Fastidiosipila spp., and Streptobacillus spp.
CONCLUSION: Diversity and composition of the GMC are associated with increased 
human exposure to enterolignans.
IMPACT: Differences in gut microbial diversity and composition explain variation 
in gut metabolic processes that affect environmental exposures and influence 
human health. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev; 24(3); 546-54. ©2014 AACR.

INTRODUCTION: Thalidomide, used to treat erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL), is 
associated with severe adverse events (AEs) and is highly teratogenic.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted on thalidomide-treated patients 
with ENL. AEs and selected variables were investigated through interviews and 
assessment of medical records. Odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were 
estimated via logistic regression.
RESULTS: Peripheral neuropathy symptoms and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) were the 
most common AEs reported. Although women of reproductive age used 
contraceptives, <50% of patients reported using condoms. Polypharmacy was 
associated with all endpoints, except DVT.
CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacovigilance is crucial to prevent harmful 
thalidomide-associated AEs.

Serum lymphocytotoxic activity in leprosy.

(1)London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.

Sera from 167 patients across the spectrum of leprosy and 46 endemic controls 
were screened for lymphocytotoxic activity (LCA). The Terasaki microdroplet 
lymphocytotoxicity assay was performed at 37 degrees C and 15 degrees C to test 
sera for LCA against a panel of lymphocytes from 50 donors which represented 
most known HLA-ABC antigens. Raised complement-dependent LCA at 15 degrees C was 
seen in leprosy patients with histories of erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) or 
reversal/Type I (I) reactions. Eighty-six per cent of lepromatous (LL) patients 
with a history of ENL (n = 21, P less than 0.001), 83% of borderline lepromatous 
(BL) and 88% of borderline tuberculoid patients (BT) with a history of Type I 
reactions (n = 12, P less than 0.01 and n = 24, P less than 0.001 respectively) 
had LCA compared to 39% of endemic controls (n = 46). LCA was attributed to IgM 
on the basis of reduced activity when serum was treated with both dithiothreitol 
or absorbed with antiserum for IgM. Removal of immune complexes and rheumatoid 
factor did not influence LCA. LCA-positive sera reacted similarly with 
allogeneic lymphocytes from either healthy donors or leprosy patients. Moreover 
LCA-positive sera reacted with autologous lymphocytes. Specificities for HLA-ABC 
antigens were not identified. The potential role of these autoantibodies, 
manifested in leprosy patients with hypersensitivity reactions remains 
speculative.

Suppressor cell activity and phenotypes in the blood or tissues of patients with 
leprosy.

Rea TH.

Suppressor cell activity has been demonstrated in the peripheral blood of 
patients with leprosy. Cells bearing the suppressor/cytotoxic phenotype have 
been enumerated in both peripheral blood and tissues, and microanatomical 
differences in tissue distribution have been observed. This first generation of 
studies has been characterized by considerable disagreement, a not unusual 
circumstance in the study of leprosy. In the case of blood suppressor cell 
activity, there appears to be no doubt as to its existence, but much uncertainty 
regarding its distribution. Concerning peripheral blood phenotypic suppressor 
cells, the observed differences in lepromatous and ENL patients may well reflect 
differences in methods used. Concerning phenotypic suppressor cells in tissue, 
there is no agreement as to their numbers or microanatomical distribution across 
the spectrum of leprosy or in its reaction states. Although these observational 
differences make firm conclusions impossible, this first generation of studies 
has provided new ways of considering old problems. For example, lepromin 
unresponsiveness might be a consequence of active cellular suppression. 
Differences in the numbers (or percentages) of the suppressor phenotype in blood 
or tissues of lepromatous patients with or without ENL reopens the door to the 
possibility of cell-mediated immune mechanisms in the pathogenesis of ENL. The 
identification of defective suppressor cells as important in the pathogenesis of 
hypergammaglobulinaemia is of interest in and of itself, but also gives rise to 
the possibility that other kinds of phenomena may be a consequence of defective 
or effete suppressor mechanisms. The observation of microanatomical differences 
in the distribution of the suppressor phenotype in tuberculoid and lepromatous 
leprosy indicates that effective or ineffective immunity might be a sequela of 
particular interactions between the suppressor/cytotoxic and helper/inducer 
phenotypes, and that these interactions merit further study. These new 
perspectives may be subject to experimental testing by the next generation of 
studies, which will surely include the techniques of clonal expansion and 
limiting dilution, as well as the study of interleukins 1 and 2.

Clofazimine (Lamprene, B663) in the treatment of lepromatous leprosy in the 
United Kingdom. A 12 year review of 31 cases, 1966-1978.

Browne SG, Harman DJ, Waudby H, McDougall AC.

This paper records the results of treatment with clofazimine of a group of 31 
patients of mixed racial origin in the United Kingdom suffering from lepromatous 
or borderline-lepromatous leprosy. Progress was assessed by clinical and 
histopathological examination for periods up to 12 years after starting 
treatment. Although given mainly for dapsone resistance, either proven on mouse 
foot pad inoculation or strongly suspected on clinical grounds, clofazimine was 
also used in some patients for the suppression of reactions, notably those due 
to the formation of immune-complexes, the manifestations of which included 
erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL). Four patients, all of whom had taken 
clofazimine in relatively high dosage for many months, usually for ENL, 
complained about pigmentation. in the remaining patients, on doses of the order 
of 100 mg three times weekly, pigmentation was not a problem. None of the 31 
patients suffered from gastro-intestinal symptoms or signs of any significance 
during the period of study. Many of the patients started taking dapsone in the 
1940s; most had a long, complex, and unsatisfactory history of previous 
treatment with many drugs. This made assessment of response to clofazimine 
difficult in some cases. The general impression is that clofazimine has been 
outstandingly valuable both as regards treatment of the bacillary infection and 
the suppression of reaction. No patient relapsed during the period of study. The 
authors express the opinion that no other drug currently available for the 
treatment of leprosy could have achieved such good results in a comparable group 
of patients.

Reactions in leprosy represent sudden shift in the immunological response and 
are seen in 11-25% of affected patients. It can be seen before, during or after 
the completion of multidrug therapy (MDT).1 Two types of reactions are 
recognized; Type 1 reaction (T1R), seen in borderline leprosy, affecting mainly 
skin and nerves; type 2 reaction (T2R) or erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL), seen 
in lepromatous leprosy, characterized by systemic features in addition to 
cutaneous lesions. Trophic ulcers and ulcerating ENL are well known entities 
while cutaneous ulceration in T1R is extremely rare; we describe an 
immune-competent woman with cutaneous ulceration as a presenting feature to 
highlight the need to recognize this entity at the earliest opportunity.

A 58-year-old Japanese man with a 2-year history of multidrug therapy for 
borderline lepromatous leprosy presented with skin lesions suggestive of 
erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) and was treated with an oral corticosteroid. As 
attempts to taper the oral corticosteroid resulted in the appearance of new 
lesions, thalidomide was added along with cyclosporin. Two months after the 
introduction of thalidomide, deep venous thrombosis (DVT) occurred in both legs 
and anticoagulant therapy was started without cessation of thalidomide. 
Pulmonary embolism developed 1 month after the appearance of DVT, and these 
thromboembolic events were believed to be due to thalidomide. This case 
highlights the need for vigilance against venous thromboembolism when 
corticosteroid and thalidomide are co-administrated for the treatment of ENL.

Lymph node abscess and cardiac involvement in a patient with nodular lepromatous 
leprosy (LL) with erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL): a rare occurrence.

Goyal T, Varshney A, Bakshi SK, Sharma V.

With the world's focus on reducing the leprosy patient load to the extent of 
elimination, finding and reporting the rarer presentations of leprosy becomes 
important for prompt treatment. Also, these untreated patients may serve as a 
potential source of infection in community. We report a 35-year old man 
diagnosed to have lepromatous leprosy and erythema nodosum leprosum with 
inguinal lymph node abscess and suspected cardiac involvement that proved fatal. 
We stress the importance of detailed workup to look for associated systemic 
involvement for timely intervention and favourable outcome.

Utility of measuring serum levels of anti-PGL-I antibody, neopterin and 
C-reactive protein in monitoring leprosy patients during multi-drug treatment 
and reactions.

OBJECTIVE: To verify the validity of measuring the levels of Mycobacterium 
leprae-specific anti-phenolic glycolipid (PGL)-I antibody, neopterin, a product 
of activated macrophages, and C-reactive protein (CRP), an acute phase protein, 
in serial serum samples from patients for monitoring the leprosy spectrum and 
reactions during the course of multi-drug treatment (MDT).
METHODS: Twenty-five untreated leprosy patients, 15 multi-bacillary (MB) and 10 
paucibacillary (PB), participated. Eight patients developed reversal reaction 
and five developed erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) during follow-up. The 
bacterial index (BI) in slit-skin smears was determined at diagnosis and blood 
samples collected by venipuncture at diagnosis and after 2, 4, 6 and 12 months 
of MDT. PGL-I antibody and neopterin were measured by enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay, whereas the CRP levels were measured by the latex 
agglutination method.
RESULTS: The levels of PGL-I antibodies and neopterin were higher in the sera of 
MB than PB patients, which correlated with the patients' BI. The serum levels of 
CRP did not differ significantly between the MB and PB patients. The serum 
levels of PGL-I and neopterin were no higher in reactional patients than 
non-reactional patients prone to such reactions. However, ENL patients had 
higher serum CRP levels than non-reactional MB patients. The serum PGL-I 
antibody levels declined significantly during MDT, in contrast to neopterin and 
CRP levels.
CONCLUSION: Measuring the serum levels of PGL-I antibodies and neopterin 
appeared to be useful in distinguishing MB from PB patients, whereas monitoring 
the levels of PGL-I antibodies appeared to be useful in monitoring MB patients 
on MDT. Measuring serum CRP, although not useful in monitoring the patients, has 
limited significance in detecting ENL reactional patients.

Olfaction in leprosy.

Chaturvedi VN, Rathi SS, Raizada RM, Jain SK.

Olfactory test was carried out in 225 cases of Hansen's disease with 75 cases 
each of lepromatous leprosy (L.L.), borderline leprosy (B.L.) and tuberculoid 
leprosy (T). Impairment of olfaction was found in 94(41.7%) cases. It was seen 
in 69.33% cases of L.L., 33.33% cases of B.L. and 22.6% cases of T. Total 
anosmia was present in 5(6.61%) cases of L.L. only. Males were more affected 
than the females. Impairment of olfaction was related to the duration of the 
disease, severity of the nasal condition, and E.N.L. reaction. It was not 
related to the type of antileprosy drug used.

The spectrum of host responses to Mycobacterium leprae provides a model for 
investigating the role of cytokines in the pathogenesis of mycobacterial 
disease. Of particular interest is tumor necrosis factor (TNF), a cytokine which 
may have both antimycobacterial and immunopathologic effects. To evaluate the 
potential role of TNF in leprosy, we measured TNF production in response to M. 
leprae and its defined constituents by peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 
patients across the spectrum of disease. The levels of TNF induced through the 
stimulation of cells with M. leprae or its dominant "lipopolysaccharide," 
lipoarabinomannan, were higher in patients with the tuberculoid form of the 
disease than in those with the lepromatous form. In patients with erythema 
nodosum leprosum (ENL), a reactional state of lepromatous leprosy, the levels of 
TNF release by peripheral blood mononuclear cells were higher than in any other 
form of the disease. Treatment of ENL patients with thalidomide reduced TNF 
secretion by more than 90%. The mycolylarabinogalactan-peptidoglycan complex of 
Mycobacterium species, the protein-peptidoglycan complex, and muramyl dipeptide 
all elicited significant TNF release. Therefore, TNF release appears to be 
triggered by at least two major cell wall structural constituents of M. leprae, 
lipoarabinomannan and segments of the cell wall skeleton. The prominent TNF 
release in patients with the paucibacillary tuberculoid form of the disease 
compared with that in patients with the multibacillary lepromatous form suggests 
that this cytokine contributes to a resistant immune response to mycobacterial 
infection. However, the marked TNF release in patients with ENL indicates that 
TNF may also mediate immunopathologic effects, such as fever and tissue damage.

Lucio's phenomenon: a comparative histological study.

Rea TH, Ridley DS.

To study further the pathogenesis of Lucio's phenomenon, we have made a 
comparative histological study of 11 patients with Lucio's phenomenon and 12 
with ENL. Confirming the findings of others, Lucio's reaction could be 
distinguished from ENL by epidermal necrosis and by necrotizing vasculitis 
manifesting necrosis in the walls of superficial vessels and severe, focal 
endothelial proliferation of mid-dermal vessels. Furthermore, in Lucio's 
phenomenon large numbers of AFB were found in evidently normal and in swollen or 
proliferating endothelial cells. We hypothesize that patients with Lucio's 
phenomenon have an exceptionally deficient defense mechanism, allowing 
unrestricted proliferation of AFB in endothelial cells, facilitating contact 
between bacterial antigen and circulating antibody and leading to infarction; 
also, this nadir of resistance allows unimpeded dissemination of AFB, accounting 
for the clinical features of diffuse non-nodular leprosy. Thus, an explanation 
is offered for the restriction of Lucio's phenomenon to patients with diffuse 
non-nodular lepromatous leprosy.

Not only macrophages, T-helper (Th)1 and Th2, but also CD4(+) CD25(high) 
FoxP3(+) regulatory T cells (T-regs) are involved in immune response to 
Mycobacterium leprae. We aimed to evaluate serum interleukin (IL)-1β and 
IL-12p70 (macrophage cytokines), interferon-γ (IFN-γ) (Th1 cytokine), IL-4 (Th2 
cytokine) and circulating CD4(+) CD25(high) FoxP3(+) T-regs, in untreated 
leprosy patients. Forty three patients and 40 controls were assessed for the 
mentioned cytokines using ELISA. Patients were assessed for circulating T-regs 
using flow cytometry. Patients were subgrouped into tuberculoid (TT), pure 
neural leprosy (PNL), borderline cases, lepromatous (LL), type 1 reactional 
leprosy (RL1) and erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL). Serum IL-12p70, IFN-γ and 
IL-4 were significantly higher in patients versus controls (P < 0.05). Serum 
IL-4 was highest in LL and lowest in RL1 (P = 0.003). Serum IL-1β levels was 
significantly higher in multibacillary versus paucibacillary patients 
(P = 0.006). Significantly higher T-regs levels was detected in TT, RL1 and PNL, 
while the lowest levels in ENL(P < 0.001), with significant differences versus 
controls (P < 0.05). FoxP3 expression% was significantly lower in PNL than other 
patients and controls (P < 0.05). T-regs/T-effs was lowest in ENL(P < 0.05). 
IFN-γ correlated positively with T-regs but negatively with IL-1β 
(P = 0.041&0.046 respectively), which correlated positively with T-effs%( 
P = 0.05). IL-4 correlated positively with T-regs FoxP3 expression% (P = 0.009). 
We concluded that: Circulating T-regs were increased in TT, RL1 and PNL 
patients, known of relatively high cell-mediated immunity. This finding was 
supported by low FoxP3 expression (in PNL) and correlation between T-regs count 
and IFN-γ level. Overproduction of IL-4 in LL may infer liability to develop 
ENL, with disease progression and immune hyperactivation, marked by deficient 
T-regs and increased T-regs FoxP3 expression%. IL-1β probably has a 
pro-inflammatory role in multibacillary patients as correlated with T-effs%.

A RUNX/AML-binding motif residing in a novel 13-bp DNA palindrome may determine 
the expression of the proximal promoter of the human uPA gene.

Urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) is a multifunctional extracellular 
serine protease implicated in different events including fibrinolysis, tissue 
remodeling, and hematopoiesis. The human uPA gene contains a major promoter 
region at around 2000 bp upstream from the transcription start site (+1), and a 
second regulatory region spanning nucleotides -90/+32 within the proximal 
promoter. Here, an inspection of this region revealed a novel 13-bp palindrome 
residing at position +8/+20. Interestingly, the palindrome contains the DNA 
consensus-binding hexamer for the RUNX/AML family of transcription factors that 
play a role in hematopoiesis, leukemia, and several developmental processes. 
Measuring the expression for promoter-reporter constructs after transfection 
revealed that deletion of the palindrome abrogated most of the proximal promoter 
activity in 293A cell. Additionally, electrophoretic mobility shift assays have 
shown that the palindrome could bind the RUNX1 component in nuclear extracts of 
myeloid cell lines exclusively through its RUNX motif. The palindrome was found 
in five additional human genes, two of which (MYH11 and MLLT1) have been linked 
to chromosomal rearrangements leading to leukemia. The data presented here have 
implicated, for the first time, RUNX/AML in the regulation of the uPA gene. The 
significance of the novel palindrome regarding gene regulation through the RUNX 
motif deserves further investigation.

Activating mutations of NOTCH1 are a common occurrence in T-cell acute 
lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL), but its impact on T-ALL treatment is still 
controversial. In this study, the incidence, clinical features, and prognosis of 
92 Chinese children with T-ALL treated using the Beijing Children's 
Hospital-2003 and Chinese Childhood Leukaemia Group-2008 protocols were 
analysed. NOTCH1 mutations were found in 42% of T-ALL patients and were not 
associated with clinical features, prednisone response, and minimal residual 
disease (MRD) at day 33 and 78. However, proline, glutamate, serine, threonine 
(PEST)/transactivation domain (TAD) mutations were associated with younger age 
(15/16 mutant vs. 48/76 wild-type, P = 0·018) and more central nervous system 
involvement (4/16 mutant vs. 3/76 wild-type, P = 0·016); while 
heterodimerization domain (HD) mutations were associated with KMT2A-MLLT1 
(MLL-ENL; 4/30 mutant vs. 1/62 wild-type, P = 0·037). Furthermore, prognosis was 
better in patients with NOTCH1 mutations than in those with wild-type NOTCH1 
(5-year event-free survival [EFS] 92·0 ± 4·5% vs. 64·0 ± 7·1%; P = 0·003). 
Long-term outcome was better in patients carrying HD mutations than in patients 
with wild-type HD (5-year EFS 89·7 ± 5·6% vs. 69·3 ± 6·2%; P = 0·034). NOTCH1 
mutations and MRD at day 78 were independent prognostic factors. These findings 
indicate that NOTCH1 mutation predicts a favourable outcome in Chinese 
paediatric patients with T-ALL on the BCH-2003 and CCLG-2008 protocols, and may 
be considered a prognostic stratification factor.

Chromosomal rearrangements of the human MLL (mixed lineage leukemia) gene are 
associated with high-risk infant, pediatric, adult and therapy-induced acute 
leukemias. We used long-distance inverse-polymerase chain reaction to 
characterize the chromosomal rearrangement of individual acute leukemia 
patients. We present data of the molecular characterization of 1590 
MLL-rearranged biopsy samples obtained from acute leukemia patients. The precise 
localization of genomic breakpoints within the MLL gene and the involved 
translocation partner genes (TPGs) were determined and novel TPGs identified. 
All patients were classified according to their gender (852 females and 745 
males), age at diagnosis (558 infant, 416 pediatric and 616 adult leukemia 
patients) and other clinical criteria. Combined data of our study and recently 
published data revealed a total of 121 different MLL rearrangements, of which 79 
TPGs are now characterized at the molecular level. However, only seven 
rearrangements seem to be predominantly associated with illegitimate 
recombinations of the MLL gene (≈ 90%): AFF1/AF4, MLLT3/AF9, MLLT1/ENL, 
MLLT10/AF10, ELL, partial tandem duplications (MLL PTDs) and MLLT4/AF6, 
respectively. The MLL breakpoint distributions for all clinical relevant 
subtypes (gender, disease type, age at diagnosis, reciprocal, complex and 
therapy-induced translocations) are presented. Finally, we present the extending 
network of reciprocal MLL fusions deriving from complex rearrangements.

BACKGROUND: Erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) is a serious immunological 
complication of leprosy, causing inflammation of skin, nerves, other organs, and 
general malaise. Many different therapies exist for ENL, but it is unclear if 
they work or which therapy is optimal.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of interventions for erythema nodosum 
leprosum.
SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, the 
Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library 
(Issue 1, 2009), MEDLINE (from 2003), EMBASE (from 2005), LILACS and AMED (from 
inception), CINAHL (from 1981), and databases of ongoing trials, all in March 
2009. We checked reference lists of articles and contacted the American Leprosy 
Missions in Brazil to locate studies.
SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of interventions for ENL 
in people with leprosy.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors performed study selection, assessed 
trial quality, and extracted data.
MAIN RESULTS: We included 13 studies with a total of 445 participants. The 
quality of the trials was generally poor and no results could be pooled due to 
the treatments being so heterogeneous. Treatment with thalidomide showed a 
significant remission of skin lesions compared to acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) 
(RR 2.43; 95% CI 1.28 to 4.59) (1 trial, 92 participants). Clofazimine treatment 
was superior to prednisolone (more treatment successes; RR 3.67; 95% CI 1.36 to 
9.91) (1 trial, 24 participants), and thalidomide (fewer recurrences; RR 0.08; 
95% CI 0.01 to 0.56) (1 trial, 72 participants). We did not find any significant 
benefit for intravenous betamethasone compared to dextrose (1 trial, 10 
participants), pentoxifylline compared to thalidomide (1 trial, 44 
participants), indomethacin compared to prednisolone, aspirin or chloroquine 
treatments (2 trials, 80 participants), or levamisole compared to placebo (1 
trial, 12 participants). Mild to moderate adverse events were significantly 
lower in participants taking 100 mg thalidomide compared to 300 mg thalidomide 
daily (RR 0.46; 95% CI 0.23 to 0.93). Significantly more minor adverse events 
were reported in participants taking clofazimine compared with prednisolone (RR 
1.92; 95% CI 1.10 to 3.35). None of the studies assessed quality of life or 
economic outcomes.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is some evidence of benefit for thalidomide and 
clofazimine, but generally we did not find clear evidence of benefit for 
interventions in the management of ENL. However, this does not mean they do not 
work, because the studies were small and poorly reported. Larger studies using 
clearly defined participants, outcome measures, and internationally recognised 
scales are urgently required.

Reciprocal chromosomal translocations at the MLL gene locus result in expression 
of novel fusion proteins, such as MLL-ENL, associated with leukemia. The three 
PHD finger cassette, one of the highly conserved domains in MLL, is absent in 
all fusion proteins. This domain has been shown to interact with Cyp33, a 
cyclophilin which enhances the recruitment of histone deacetylases (HDAC) to the 
MLL repression domain and mediates HOX gene repression. Insertion of the third 
PHD finger of MLL into MLL-ENL allows the recruitment of Cyp33 and, 
subsequently, HDAC1 to the fusion protein. Furthermore, expression of the fusion 
protein with the PHD finger insertion mediates the down-regulation of the HOXC8 
gene expression in a Cyp33-dependent manner. Finally, the addition of the PHD 
finger domain or the third PHD finger alone into MLL-ENL blocks the 
hematopoietic stem cell immortalization potential of the fusion protein in 
serial plating colony assays. Insertion of only the first and second PHD fingers 
has no such effect. These data support the hypothesis that the binding of Cyp33 
to the MLL third PHD finger switches the MLL function from transactivation to 
repression. In the immortalizing MLL fusion protein, the loss of the PHD 
fingers, in combination with the gain of the activation domain of ENL or of 
other partner proteins, makes the fusion protein a constitutive transactivator. 
This leads to constitutive overexpression of MLL target genes that block stem 
cell commitment and promote stem cell renewal, probably the first step in 
MLL-related leukemogenesis.

Secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG), a lignan extracted from flaxseed, has 
been shown to suppress benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). However, little is 
known about the mechanistic basis for its anti-BPH activity. The present study 
showed that enterolactone (ENL), the mammalian metabolite of SDG, shared the 
similar binding site of G1 on a new type of membranous estrogen receptor, 
G-protein-coupled estrogen eceptor 1 (GPER), by docking simulations method. ENL 
and G1 (the specific agonist of GPER) inhibited the proliferation of human 
prostate stromal cell line WPMY-1 as shown by MTT assay and arrested cell cycle 
at the G0/G1 phase, which was displayed by propidium iodide staining following 
flow cytometer examination. Silencing GPER by short interfering RNA attenuated 
the inhibitory effect of ENL on WPMY-1 cells. The therapeutic potential of SDG 
in the treatment of BPH was confirmed in a testosterone propionate-induced BPH 
rat model. SDG significantly reduced the enlargement of the rat prostate and the 
number of papillary projections of prostatic alveolus and thickness of the 
pseudostratified epithelial and stromal cells when comparing with the model 
group. Mechanistic studies showed that SDG and ENL increased the expression of 
GPER both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, ENL-induced cell cycle arrest may 
be mediated by the activation of GPER/ERK pathway and subsequent upregulation of 
p53 and p21 and downregulation of cyclin D1. This work, in tandem with previous 
studies, will enhance our knowledge regarding the mechanism(s) of dietary 
phytochemicals on BPH prevention and ultimately expand the scope of adopting 
alternative approaches in BPH treatment.

BACKGROUND: Leprosy reactions, reversal reactions/RR and erythema nodosum 
leprosum/ENL, can cause irreversible nerve damage, handicaps and deformities. 
The study of Mycobacterium leprae-specific serologic responses at diagnosis in 
the cohort of patients enrolled at the Clinical Trial for Uniform Multidrug 
Therapy Regimen for Leprosy Patients in Brazil/U-MDT/CT-BR is suitable to 
evaluate its prognostic value for the development of reactions.
METHODOLOGY: IgM and IgG antibody responses to PGL-I, LID-1, ND-O-LID were 
evaluated by ELISA in 452 reaction-free leprosy patients at diagnosis, enrolled 
and monitored for the development of leprosy reactions during a total 
person-time of 780,930 person-days, i.e. 2139.5 person-years, with a maximum of 
6.66 years follow-up time.
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Among these patients, 36% (160/452) developed reactions 
during follow-up: 26% (119/452) RR and 10% (41/452) had ENL. At baseline higher 
anti-PGL-I, anti-LID-1 and anti-ND-O-LID seropositivity rates were seen in 
patients who developed ENL and RR compared to reaction-free patients (p<0.0001). 
Seroreactivity in reactional and reaction-free patients was stratified by 
bacilloscopic index/BI categories. Among BI negative patients, higher anti-PGL-I 
levels were seen in RR compared to reaction-free patients (p = 0.014). In 
patients with 0<BI<3, (36 RR, 36 reaction-free), higher antibody levels to PGL-I 
(p = 0.014) and to LID-1 (p = 0.035) were seen in RR while difference in 
anti-ND-O-LID positivity was borderline (p = 0.052). Patients with BI≥3 that 
developed ENL had higher levels of anti-LID-1 antibodies (p = 0.028) compared to 
reaction-free patients. Anti-PGL-I serology had a limited predictive value for 
RR according to receiver operating curve/ROC analyses (area-under-the-curve/AUC 
= 0.7). Anti LID-1 serology at baseline showed the best performance to predict 
ENL (AUC 0.85).
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, detection of anti-PGL-I, anti-LID-1 and anti-ND-O-LID 
antibodies at diagnosis, showed low sensitivity and specificity for RR 
prediction, indicating low applicability of serological tests for RR prognosis. 
On the other hand, anti-LID-1 serology at diagnosis has shown prognostic value 
for ENL development in BI positive patients.

PURPOSE: Exposure to the polyphenolic plant lignan secoisolariciresinol 
diglucoside (SDG) and its metabolite enterolactone (ENL) has been associated 
with reduced breast cancer progression, particularly for estrogen receptor alpha 
(ERα)-negative disease, and decreased preclinical mammary tumor growth. However, 
while preclinical studies have established that SDG and ENL affect measures of 
progression in models of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC, a subset of 
ERα-negative disease), the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects remain 
unclear.
METHODS: C57BL/6 mice were fed a control diet (control, 10% kcal from fat) or 
control diet + SDG (SDG, 100 mg/kg diet) for 8 weeks, then orthotopically 
injected with syngeneic E0771 mammary tumor cells (a model of TNBC); tumor 
growth was monitored for 3 weeks. The role of reduced NF-κB signaling in SDG's 
anti-tumor effects was explored in vitro via treatment with the bioactive SDG 
metabolite ENL. In addition to the murine E0771 cells, the in vitro studies 
utilized MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells, two human cell lines which model the 
triple-negative and luminal A breast cancer subtypes, respectively.
RESULTS: SDG supplementation in the mice significantly reduced tumor volume and 
expression of phospho-p65 and NF-κB target genes (P < 0.05). Markers of 
macrophage infiltration were decreased in the distal-to-tumor mammary fat pad of 
mice supplemented with SDG relative to control mice (P < 0.05). In vitro, ENL 
treatment inhibited viability, survival, and NF-κB activity and target gene 
expression in E0771, MDA-MB-231, and MCF-7 cells (P < 0.05). Overexpression of 
Rela attenuated ENL's inhibition of E0771 cell viability and survival.
CONCLUSIONS: SDG reduces tumor growth in the E0771 model of TNBC, likely via a 
mechanism involving inhibition of NF-κB activity. SDG could serve as a practical 
and effective adjuvant treatment to reduce recurrence, but greater understanding 
of its effects is needed to inform the development of more targeted 
recommendations for its use.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized 
by progressive muscle paralysis, which is followed by degeneration of motor 
neurons in the motor cortex of the brainstem and spinal cord. The etiology of 
sporadic ALS (sALS) is still unknown, limiting the exploration of potential 
treatments. Ferroptosis is a new form of cell death and is reported to be 
closely associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and 
ALS. In this study, we used datasets (autopsy data and blood data) from Gene 
Expression Omnibus (GEO) to explore the role of ferroptosis and 
ferroptosis-related gene (FRG) alterations in ALS. Gene set enrichment analysis 
(GSEA) found that the activated ferroptosis pathway displayed a higher 
enrichment score, and the expression of 26 ferroptosis genes showed obvious 
group differences between ALS and controls. Using weighted gene correlation 
network analysis (WGCNA), we identified FRGs associated with ALS, of which the 
Gene Ontology (GO) analysis displayed that the biological process of oxidative 
stress was the most to be involved in. KEGG pathway analysis revealed that the 
FRGs were enriched not only in ferroptosis pathways but also in autophagy, FoxO, 
and mTOR signaling pathways. Twenty-one FRGs (NR4A1, CYBB, DRD4, SETD1B, LAMP2, 
ACSL4, MYB, PROM2, CHMP5, ULK1, AKR1C2, TGFBR1, TMBIM4, MLLT1, PSAT1, HIF1A, 
LINC00336, AMN, SLC38A1, CISD1, and GABARAPL2) in the autopsy data and 16 FRGs 
(NR4A1, DRD4, SETD1B, MYB, PROM2, CHMP5, ULK1, AKR1C2, TGFBR1, TMBIM4, MLLT1, 
HIF1A, LINC00336, IL33, SLC38A1, and CISD1) in the blood data were identified as 
target genes by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator analysis 
(LASSO), in which gene signature could differentiate ALS patients from controls. 
Finally, the higher the expression of CHMP5 and SLC38A1 in whole blood, the 
shorter the lifespan of ALS patients will be. In summary, our study presents 
potential biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of ALS.

Cancer cells are characterized by aberrant epigenetic landscapes and often 
exploit chromatin machinery to activate oncogenic gene expression programs. 
Recognition of modified histones by 'reader' proteins constitutes a key 
mechanism underlying these processes; therefore, targeting such pathways holds 
clinical promise, as exemplified by the development of bromodomain and 
extra-terminal (BET) inhibitors. We recently identified the YEATS domain as an 
acetyl-lysine-binding module, but its functional importance in human cancer 
remains unknown. Here we show that the YEATS domain-containing protein ENL, but 
not its paralogue AF9, is required for disease maintenance in acute myeloid 
leukaemia. CRISPR-Cas9-mediated depletion of ENL led to anti-leukaemic effects, 
including increased terminal myeloid differentiation and suppression of 
leukaemia growth in vitro and in vivo. Biochemical and crystal structural 
studies and chromatin-immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing analyses 
revealed that ENL binds to acetylated histone H3, and co-localizes with H3K27ac 
and H3K9ac on the promoters of actively transcribed genes that are essential for 
leukaemia. Disrupting the interaction between the YEATS domain and histone 
acetylation via structure-based mutagenesis reduced the recruitment of RNA 
polymerase II to ENL-target genes, leading to the suppression of oncogenic gene 
expression programs. Notably, disrupting the functionality of ENL further 
sensitized leukaemia cells to BET inhibitors. Together, our data identify ENL as 
a histone acetylation reader that regulates oncogenic transcriptional programs 
in acute myeloid leukaemia, and suggest that displacement of ENL from chromatin 
may be a promising epigenetic therapy, alone or in combination with BET 
inhibitors, for aggressive leukaemia.

Leprosy is a chronic granulomatous disease involving the skin and nerves, 
leading to a debilitating condition. Leprosy has been controlled in most parts 
of the world; therefore physicians are not very well versed in the recognition, 
management and assessment of this disease. The protean manifestations of leprosy 
often lead to delays in diagnosis and increase the morbidity. We present a case 
of a 33-year-old male with fever, lymphadenopathy, nodular skin lesions, uveitis 
and arthritis. Lymphnode, bonemarrow and skin biopsy revealed 3+ AFB smear with 
negative AFB cultures, leading to the diagnosis of leprosy. The course of 
illness was complicated by flare of Erythema Nodosum Leprosum (ENL).

On the basis of a previously identified DOT1L peptide mimetic (compound 3), a 
series of novel peptide mimetics were designed and synthesized. These compounds 
can potently bind to AF9 and ENL either in cell-free binding assays or in 
leukemia cells, and selectively inhibit the growth of leukemia cells containing 
mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) fusion proteins. The most potent compound 12 
exhibited comparable anticancer cellular activities to those of EPZ5676, a 
clinical stage enzymatic inhibitor of DOT1L in several leukemia cell lines 
containing MLL fusion proteins. Mechanism studies for compound 12 indicated that 
it did not affect the global methylation of H3K79 catalyzed by DOT1L but could 
effectively suppress the methylation of H3K79 at MLL fusion proteins targeted 
genes and inhibit the expressions of these genes. Our studies thus demonstrated 
that inhibiting the protein-protein interactions between DOT1L and MLL fusion 
proteins is a potentially effective strategy for the treatment of MLL rearranged 
leukemias.

High-resolution (HR) retinal optical coherence tomography (OCT) images are 
preferred by the ophthalmologists to diagnose retinal diseases. These images can 
be obtained by dense scanning of the target retinal region during acquisition. 
However, a dense scanning increases the image acquisition time and introduces 
motion artefacts, which corrupt diagnostic information. Therefore, researchers 
have a growing interest in developing image processing techniques to recover HR 
images from low-resolution (LR) OCT images. In this paper, we present an 
automated super-resolution (SR) scheme using diagnostic information weighted 
sparse representation framework to reconstruct HR images from LR OCT images. The 
proposed method performs fast and reliable reconstruction of the LR images. We 
also propose a 2D- variational mode decomposition (VMD) based OCT diagnostic 
distortion measure (QOCT) to quantify diagnostic distortion in the reconstructed 
OCT images. The SR method is evaluated on clinical grade OCT images with the 
proposed diagnostic distortion measure along with the conventional 
non-diagnostic measures like the contrast to noise ratio (CNR), the equivalent 
number of looks (ENL) and the peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR). The results 
show an average CNR of 4.07, ENL of 58.96 and PSNR of 27.72 dB. An average score 
of 1.53 is obtained using the proposed diagnostic distortion measure. 
Experimental results quantify that the proposed QOCT metric can effectively 
capture diagnostic distortion.

Lysine acetylation is an epigenetic mark that is principally recognized by 
bromodomains, and recently structurally diverse YEATS domains also emerged as 
readers of lysine acetyl/acylations. Here we present a crystallography-based 
strategy and the discovery of fragments binding to the ENL YEATS domain, a 
potential drug target. Crystal structures combined with synthetic efforts led to 
the identification of a submicromolar binder, providing first starting points 
for the development of chemical probes for this reader domain family.

Inflammatory and subcutaneous nodules can arise in treated and untreated cases 
of Whipple disease (WD). The inflammatory immune reconstitution syndrome 
describes paradoxical clinical inflammatory worsening of a preexisting condition 
because of a return of immune function. Clinicopathologic examination of 4 
patients with WD who presented with erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL)-like lesions 
and the findings of a systematic review of this phenomenon revealed that 
ENL-like lesions occurred in predominantly middle-aged male patients who 
suffered from WD, mostly on the legs. Patients showed a nonvasculitic, mostly 
septal panniculits with neutrophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes. Numerous 
bacteria-laden periodic acid-Schiff + macrophages and free bacilli were detected 
in the dermis, as well as subcutaneous septae and adipose lobules. These lesions 
occurred in both untreated and treated patients as part of inflammatory immune 
reconstitution syndrome. In conclusion, ENL-like lesions represent a 
characteristic histopathologic pattern associated with WD, which can occur in 
different contexts whenever there is a change in the immunological status of the 
patient. This change can be triggered by antimicrobial treatment, 
immunomodulatory and immunosuppressant therapy, or occur spontaneously, rarely.

Spaced clofazimine therapy of lepromatous leprosy.

[No authors listed]

Patients with previously untreated borderline-lepromatous or fully lepromatous 
leprosy were treated with one of five clofazimine (B663) regimens: 1) 200 mg 
daily 6 days per week; 2) 100 mg three times weekly; 3) 300 mg weekly; 4) 600 mg 
every other week; and 5) 600 mg on 2 consecutive days every 4 weeks. After 24 
weeks of treatment, the patients were randomly allocated to treatment either 
with 200 mg B663 daily 6 days per week (regimen 6) or with dapsone, beginning 
with a small dosage and increasing over a period of 8 weeks to 100 mg daily 6 
days per week (regimen 7). Death of Mycobacterium leprae was monitored by mouse 
inoculation with organisms recovered from skin biopsy specimens obtained at 
intervals during the first 24 weeks. Killing of M. leprae proceeded most rapidly 
in regimen 1 and 2 patients, least rapidly in the patients of regimens 4 and 5, 
and at an intermediate rate in regimen 3 patients. Erythema nodosum leprosum 
(ENL) was no more frequent nor more severe during treatment with any one of the 
first-24-weeks regimen. ENL was more frequent in regimen 7 than in regimen 6 
patients. Pigmentation of the skin, assessed only during the first 24 weeks, 
occurred in patients of all regimens, but was most marked in regimen 1 patients. 
No evidence of B663 toxicity was noted. Although of all of the first 24-weeks 
regimens were effective in terms of the rate of killing of M. lepare, greater 
effectiveness was associated with more frequent administration of the drug. The 
B663 that accumulated in the tissues did not appear to be available to exert an 
antimicrobial effect.

BACKGROUND: Leprosy reactions appear episodically in leprosy patients, which 
lead to high inflammation, morbidity and peripheral nerve damage. The role of 
Th17 cell has been well studied in leprosy reactions but the role of γδ or 
unconventional T cells which is an other major source of IL-17 in many diseases, 
not studied in leprosy reactional episodes.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study to elucidate the role of γδ T cells in 
leprosy reactions.
METHODOLOGY: A total of 40 untreated non-reaction and reactions patients were 
recruited. PBMCs were isolated and stimulated with M. leprae sonicated antigen 
(MLSA) for 48 h and immuno-phenotyping was done using flow cytometry. Moreover, 
γδ T cells were isolated by Magnetic beads technology and mRNA expression of 
IL-17, IFN-γ, TGF-β and FOXP3 were analyzed by real-time PCR (qPCR) and cytokine 
was estimated in the culture supernatant by ELISA.
RESULTS: γδ T cells were significantly increased in both Reversal reaction (RR) 
and Erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) reaction patients. These cells produced 
significant amount of IL-17 and IFN-γ. Furthermore, CD3+TCRγδ+ T cells expressed 
transient FOXP3 with a low amount of TGF-β in both reactions as compared to 
stable patients. Moreover, low TGF-β producing TCR-γδ cells were associated with 
low phosphorylation of STAT5A.
CONCLUSION: This study will add to our understanding of the immunological 
features that mediate and regulate the pathogenesis of leprosy and may helpful 
to reduce the immuno-pathogenesis of leprosy reaction by targeting these cells.

Tamoxifen, flaxseed, and the lignan enterolactone increase stroma- and cancer 
cell-derived IL-1Ra and decrease tumor angiogenesis in estrogen-dependent breast 
cancer.

Oncology, Linkoping, Sweden.

The proinflammatory cytokines IL-1α and IL-1β promote tumor angiogenesis that 
might be counteracted by the IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), anakinra, a 
clinically approved agent. A diet with high amounts of phytoestrogens, such as 
flaxseed (Flax), genistein (GEN), and the mammalian lignan enterolactone (ENL), 
may affect breast cancer progression in a similar fashion as the antiestrogen 
tamoxifen. Both cancer cells and tumor stroma may be targets for cancer therapy. 
By using microdialysis in a model of human breast cancers in nude mice, we could 
perform species-specific analyses of released proteins in the microenvironment. 
We show that tumors treated with tamoxifen and fed Flax or ENL exhibited 
decreased in vivo release of IL-1β derived from the murine stroma and decreased 
microvessel density whereas dietary GEN had no effects. Cancer cell-released 
IL-1Ra were approximately 5 times higher than stroma-derived IL-1Ra. Tamoxifen, 
Flax, and ENL increased IL-1Ra levels significantly whereas GEN did not. The 
tumor stroma contained macrophages, which expressed the estrogen receptor. In 
vitro, estradiol decreased IL-1Ra released from breast cancer cells and from 
cultured macrophages. IL-1Ra decreased endothelial cell proliferation 
significantly in vitro whereas breast cancer cell proliferation was unaffected 
in presence of estradiol. Finally, IL-1Ra therapy of tumor-bearing mice opposed 
estrogen-dependent breast cancer growth and decreased angiogenesis. We conclude 
that the release of IL-1s both by cancer cells and the stroma, where macrophages 
are a key component, may offer feasible targets for antiestrogen therapy and 
dietary interventions against breast cancer.

Author information:

The serum concentrations of lactoferrin were determined by competitive enzyme 
immunoassay in the sera of 38 lepromatous leprosy patients and 16 healthy 
volunteers. Of the 38 lepromatous patients, 25 were without any sign of 
reactions while 13 were suffering from ENL type of reactions. The lactoferrin 
levels, in both types of patients, were observed to be significantly higher (P < 
0.01 and < 0.001, respectively) than in that of healthy volunteers. The rise in 
lactoferrin level in reactive patients was also higher (P < 0.05) when compared 
to those without reactions. The serum lactoferrin levels were also found to be 
associated with bacterial load (r = 0.414; P < 0.01) indicating that in 
lepromatous leprosy patients, lactoferrin may not be very effective in 
preventing the growth of Mycobacterium leprae. Further studies to improve the 
understanding of the role of elevated levels of lactoferrin in pathogenesis of 
lepromatous leprosy patients and in establishing its possible use in predicting 
the occurrence of ENL type of reactions would be worthwhile pursuing.

Evaluation of a novel 2,3-diacyl-trehalose-2'-sulphate (SL-IV) antigen for case 
finding and diagnosis of leprosy and tuberculosis.

Serum IgG and IgM antibodies against a 2,3-diacyl-trehalose-2'-sulphate (SL-IV) 
antigen using ELISA were determined in controls (n = 288) and in leprosy (n = 
210) and tuberculosis (n = 99) patients. In all assays, the amount of antigen 
per well was 100.0 ng and sera were diluted 1/250. In the case of leprosy, 
anti-SL-IV IgG and IgM antibody titres increased from the tuberculoid towards 
the lepromatous pole of the spectrum. In the tested population, the sensitivity 
of the assay was 93.2% in multibacillary leprosy and 33.3% in paucibacillary 
leprosy (specificity of 88.7%). Multibacillary patients with erythema nodosum 
leprosum (ENL) had lower titres than non-ENL. ELISA results were similar to 
those obtained using the Mycobacterium leprae phenolic glycolipid-I (PGL-I) 
antigen. In the case of tuberculosis (pulmonary and extrapulmonary), significant 
titres of anti SL-IV IgG and IgM antibodies were detected in about 75% of the 
patients using a cutoff point of 0.150, and in 51.6% using a cutoff of 0.300 
(specificities were, respectively, 88% and 100%). We concluded that the 
determination of IgG and IgM antibodies against SL-IV was useful in leprosy and 
tuberculosis case finding program using a cutoff point of 0.150, and for 
serodiagnosis using a cutoff of 0.300.

AIMS: The aim of this study was to assess the effects of enterolactone (ENL) on 
lipid fractions fatty acids composition affecting hepatocyte inflammation 
development.
MAIN METHODS: The experiments were conducted in HepG2 cells incubated with ENL 
and/or palmitic acid (16 h). Intracellular contents of free fatty acids (FFA), 
di- (DAG) and tri- (TAG) acylglycerol as well as their fatty acids compositions 
were assessed by Gas-Liquid Chromatography. Moreover, the ω-6/ω-3 ratios in the 
above mentioned lipids fractions were estimated. The expression of proteins 
involved in eicosanoids and prostanoids production (COX-2, 15-LOX), inflammatory 
process (TNFα), as well as the proteins participating in the desaturation (SCD 
1) and elongation (Elovl 3, Elovl 6) of fatty acids were evaluated by Western 
Blot.
KEY FINDINGS: Enterolactone modified fatty acids composition in FFA, DAG and TAG 
fractions. In conjunction with lipid overload, it increased the content of ω-6 
more than ω-3 PUFA. Moreover, it enhanced the expressions of Elovl 3, Elovl 6, 
COX-2 and TNFα, whereas it had no influence on SCD 1 and 15-LOX level.
SIGNIFICANCE: Our study revealed that the supplementation with ENL affected 
intracellular hepatic composition of saturated as well as unsaturated fatty 
acids in each of the investigated lipid fractions. Based on the shift in the 
ω-6/ω-3 balance towards ω-6, as well as the increase in COX-2 and TNFα protein 
expressions, we may postulate a pro-inflammatory nature of the examined 
polyphenol. Moreover, our findings could prove to be useful in the future 
research in the topic of widespread diseases such as NASH.

Thirty postmenopausal women (11 omnivores, 10 vegetarians and 9 apparently 
healthy women with surgically removed breast cancer) were investigated with 
regard to the association of their urinary excretion of estrogens, lignans and 
isoflavonoids (all diphenols) with plasma sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG). A 
statistically significant positive correlation between urinary total diphenol 
excretion and plasma SHBG was found which remained statistically significant 
after elimination of the confounding effect of body mass determined by body mass 
index (BMI). Furthermore we found a statistically significant negative 
correlation between plasma SHBG and urinary excretion of 16 alpha-hydroxyestrone 
and estriol which also remained significant after eliminating the effect of BMI. 
Furthermore we observed that enterolactone (Enl) stimulates the synthesis of 
SHBG by HepG2 liver cancer cells in culture acting synergistically with 
estradiol and at physiological concentrations. Enl was rapidly conjugated by the 
liver cells, mainly to its monosulfate. Several lignans and the isoflavonoids 
daidzein and equol were found to compete with estradiol for binding to the rat 
uterine type II estrogen binding site (the s.c. bioflavonoid receptor). It is 
suggested that lignans and isoflavonoids may affect uptake and metabolism of sex 
hormones by participating in the regulation of plasma SHBG levels and in this 
way influence their biological activity and that they may inhibit cancer cell 
growth like some flavonoids by competing with estradiol for the type II estrogen 
binding sites.

Previously, we showed that CDYL1 is recruited to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) 
to promote homologous recombination (HR) repair and foster transcriptional 
silencing. However, how CDYL1 elicits DSB-induced silencing is not fully 
understood. Here, we identify a CDYL1-dependent local decrease in the 
transcriptionally active marks histone lysine crotonylation (Kcr) and 
crotonylated lysine 9 of H3 (H3K9cr) at AsiSI-induced DSBs, which correlates 
with transcriptional silencing. Mechanistically, we reveal that CDYL1 
crotonyl-CoA hydratase activity counteracts Kcr and H3K9cr at DSB sites, which 
triggers the eviction of the transcription elongation factor ENL and fosters 
transcriptional silencing. Furthermore, genetic inhibition of CDYL1 hydratase 
activity blocks the reduction in H3K9cr and alleviates DSB-induced silencing, 
whereas HR efficiency unexpectedly remains intact. Therefore, our results 
functionally uncouple the repair and silencing activity of CDYL1 at DSBs. In a 
broader context, we address a long-standing question concerning the functional 
relationship between HR repair and DSB-induced silencing, suggesting that they 
may occur independently.

Dietary lignans show some promising health benefits, but little is known about 
their fate and activities in the small intestine. The purpose of this study was 
thus to investigate whether plant lignans are taken up by intestinal cells and 
modulate the intestinal inflammatory response using the Caco-2 cell model. Six 
lignan standards [secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG), secoisolariciresinol 
(SECO), pinoresinol (PINO), lariciresinol, matairesinol (MAT), and 
hydroxymatairesinol] and their colonic metabolites [enterolactone (ENL) and 
enterodiol] were studied. First, differentiated cells were exposed to SDG, SECO, 
PINO, or ENL at increasing concentrations for 4 h, and their cellular contents 
(before and after deconjugation) were determined by HPLC. Second, in 
IL-1β-stimulated confluent and/or differentiated cells, lignan effects were 
tested on different soluble proinflammatory mediators quantified by enzyme 
immunoassays and on the NF-κB activation pathway by using cells transiently 
transfected. SECO, PINO, and ENL, but not SDG, were taken up and partly 
conjugated by cells, which is a saturable conjugation process. PINO was the most 
efficiently conjugated (75% of total in cells). In inflamed cells, PINO 
significantly reduced IL-6 by 65% and 30% in confluent and differentiated cells, 
respectively, and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2-derived prostaglandin E(2) by 62% in 
confluent cells. In contrast, MAT increased significantly COX-2-derived 
prostaglandin E(2) in confluent cells. Moreover, PINO dose-dependently decreased 
IL-6 and macrophage chemoattractant protein-1 secretions and NF-κB activity. Our 
findings suggest that plant lignans can be absorbed and metabolized in the small 
intestine and, among the plant lignans tested, PINO exhibited the strongest 
antiinflammatory properties by acting on the NF-κB signaling pathway, possibly 
in relation to its furofuran structure and/or its intestinal metabolism.

Prolonged treatment with recombinant interferon gamma induces erythema nodosum 
leprosum in lepromatous leprosy patients.

Author information:
(1)Laboratory of Cellular Physiology and Immunology, Rockefeller University, New 
York, New York 10021.

10 patients with borderline and lepromatous leprosy were selected for a 
prolonged trial with recombinant interferon gamma (rIFN-gamma). Patients 
received 30 micrograms intradermally for six injections over a 9-d period, and 
then either 100 micrograms intradermally every 1 mo for 10 mo or every 2 wk for 
5 mo (total, 1.2 mg). Erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) was induced in 60% of the 
patients within 6-7 mo, as compared with an incidence of 15% per year with 
multiple drug therapy alone. The mean whole-body reduction in bacterial index 
over the first 6 mo was 0.9 log units. Cutaneous induration at the intradermal 
injection sites of greater than or equal to 15 mm predicted the development of a 
subsequent reactional state. Monocytes obtained from patients receiving the 
lymphokine demonstrated an increased respiratory burst and a 2.5-5.1-fold 
increase in tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) secretion in response to 
agonists. Patients in ENL had an even higher release of TNF-alpha from monocytes 
as well as high levels of TNF-alpha in the plasma (mean, 2,000 pg/ml). 
Thalidomide therapy was required to treat the systemic manifestations of ENL. 
Control of toxic symptoms with thalidomide was associated with a 50-80% 
reduction in agonist-stimulated monocyte TNF-alpha secretion. IFN-gamma enhanced 
the monocyte release of TNF-alpha by 3-7.5-fold (agonist dependent) when added 
to patient's cells in vitro, and this could be suppressed by the in vitro 
addition of 10 micrograms/ml of thalidomide.

This case report depicts a case of histopathologically confirmed polar 
lepromatous (LL) leprosy with a bacterial index of 4+. He experienced recurrent 
episodes of erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) in the first 5 years after 
diagnosis. Skin smears became negative after 6 years of dapsone monotherapy and 
have remained negative since that time. At 23 years after diagnosis, the patient 
had developed cataracts and underwent intracapsular cataract extractions with 
broad-based iridectomies. In one of the iris specimens, histopathologic 
examination revealed a focal granuloma composed of epithelioid cells. 
Subsequently a lepromin skin test showed a positive Mitsuda reaction with a 
borderline tuberculoid histopathology. This clearly illustrates the 
immunological upgrading of a polar lepromatous patient, perceived first in the 
iris tissue.

The impact of multiple drug therapy on leprosy disabilities.

Willcox ML(1).

Author information:
(1)Keble College, Oxford, UK.

In an overview of controlled trials, it is shown that bactericidal drugs 
increase the short-term risk of Type I reactions, but prevent the long-term 
development of new impairments caused by bacterial proliferation. Clinical 
experience suggests that the clofazimine component of multiple drug therapy 
(MDT) has reduced the incidence of Type II reactions or erythema nodosum 
leprosum (ENL). The principal impact of MDT, compared with monotherapy, has been 
to reduce the duration of active disease, thus preventing the deterioration of 
disability scores. Reduction of population disability rates is mainly achieved 
by earlier detection and treatment. MDT has a number of indirect benefits such 
as improved compliance, decreased cost, and increased motivation and 
availability of leprosy workers. However, MDT must be supplemented by other 
measures to prevent and treat disabilities.

The effect of clofazimine on liver function tests in lepra reaction (ENL).

Bulakh PM, Kowale CN, Ranade SM, Burte NP, Chandorkar AG.

Twenty patients with suspected DDS resistance and repeated attacks of lepra 
reactions were selected for the study. Clofazimine was administered in different 
doses over a period of 12 months. Elevated levels of transaminases and Alkaline 
phosphatase prior therapy attained values to near normalcy. Progressive fall in 
serum Bilirubin and Proteins with normal A/G ratio at the end of therapy was 
also observed. Clofazimine by its anti-inflammatory and antibacterial action 
could inhibit the process of liver damage and happened to have minimal 
deleterious effect on liver by studying the liver function tests.

Does light attract piglets to the creep area?

Tjele,Denmark.

Hypothermia, experienced by piglets, has been related to piglet deaths and high 
and early use of a heated creep area is considered important to prevent 
hypothermia. The aims of the present study were to investigate how a newly 
invented radiant heat source, eHeat, would affect piglets' use of the creep area 
and whether light in the creep area works as an attractant on piglets. A total 
of 39 sows, divided between two batches, were randomly distributed to three heat 
source treatments: (1) standard infrared heat lamp (CONT, n=19), (2) eHeat with 
light (EL, n=10) and (3) eHeat without light (ENL, n=10). Recordings of piglets' 
use of the creep area were made as scan sampling every 10 min for 3 h during two 
periods, one in daylight (0900 to 1200 h) and one in darkness (2100 to 2400 h), 
on day 1, 2, 3, 7, 14 and 21 postpartum. On the same days, piglets were 
weighted. Results showed an interaction between treatment and observation period 
(P<0.05) with a lower use of the creep area during darkness compared with 
daylight for CONT and EL litters, but not for ENL litters. Piglets average daily 
weight gain was not affected by treatment, but was positively correlated with 
piglets' birth weight and was lower in batch 1 compared with batch 2. Seen from 
the present results, neither eHeat nor light worked as an attractant on piglets; 
in contrast, piglets preferred to sleep in the dark and it would therefore be 
recommended to turn off the light in the creep area during darkness. Heating up 
the creep area without light can be accomplished by using a radiant heat source 
such as eHeat in contrast to the normally used light-emitting infrared heat 
lamp.

Sulphatide-binding properties are shared by serum amyloid P component and a 
polyreactive germ-line IgM autoantibody, the TH3 idiotype.

Wheeler PR(1), Raynes JG, O'Sullivan GM, Duggan D, McAdam KP.

Medicine, UK.

Serum amyloid P component (SAP) concentration was elevated in sera from leprosy 
patients, significantly so above endemic controls in lepromatous cases. In the 
sera of lepromatous leprosy (LL) patients who experienced an erythema nodosum 
leprosum (ENL) episode the SAP fell at the onset of ENL and remained low 
throughout, in two of three cases. Changes in SAP concentration parallel 
anti-sulphatide IgM concentrations. TH3, a monoclonal IgM germ-line antibody 
derived from a LL patient, and SAP share similar binding patterns. In this study 
we demonstrate binding to heparin and sulphatide. Moreover, SAP inhibited the 
binding of TH3 to sulphatide, as well as anti-sulphatide IgM found in a range of 
sera, and anti-sulphatide IgG in the only sera sample in which it was found. The 
observation that anti-TH3 idiotype monoclonal and polyclonal anti-SAP antibodies 
both inhibited the binding of TH3 and IgM in sera (but not IgG) to sulphatide 
without binding to sulphatide themselves further demonstrated similar binding 
specificities. The observations of similarity in binding reinforce ideas that 
SAP may function as a primitive opsonin, but the clear ability to inhibit 
binding of autoantibodies suggests that SAP may play a role in ameliorating 
tissue and particularly nerve damage in leprosy patients.

Studies on T cell subsets and functions in leprosy.

Bach MA, Chatenoud L, Wallach D, Phan Dinh Tuy F, Cottenot F.

T cell subsets and T cell functions were explored in 31 leprosy patients with 
the following methods: determination of the percentages of the different T cell 
subpopulations defined by monoclonal antibodies directed at total T cells, 
helper T cells and suppressor/cytotoxic T cells; measurement of the in vitro 
proliferative responses to mitogens; study of the concanavalin A-induced 
suppressive activity, assessed on MLC; measurement of delayed-type 
hypersensitivity by skin testing. The confrontation between immunological 
lepromatous patients without type-2 reaction (erythema nodosum leprosum), (2) 
lepromatous patients without ENL (erythema nodosum leprosum), (2) lepromatous 
patients was recent ENL and (3) tuberculoid patients. Unexpectedly, groups 1 and 
3, although differing strongly in their clinical status and their sensitivity to 
lepromin (absent in group 1 and strong in group 3), showed a similar 
immunological profile with a normal percentage of T cells and a normal 
distribution of T cells among the major T cell subset contrasting with a 
moderate decrease of proliferative responses to mitogens and impaired 
delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions. Concanavalin A-induced suppressive 
activity was type-2 reaction) strongly differed from both other groups, showing 
striking abnormalities other groups, showing striking abnormalities of the 
repartition of the T cell subsets, with increased percentages of helper T cells 
and decreased percentages of suppressor T cells, and elevated proliferative 
responses to mitogens. Concanavalin A-induced suppressive activity was reduced 
in most patients of this group. It is suggested that this imbalance between T 
cell subsets contributes to the occurrence of ENL reactions in lepromatous 
patients.

BACKGROUND: Thalidomide is best known as a major teratogen that caused birth 
defects in up to 12,000 children in the 1960s. More recently, this agent has 
been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of 
erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) through a restricted-use program. Its 
immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and antiangiogenic properties are currently 
under study in a number of clinical conditions.
OBJECTIVE: This article reviews the pharmacology of thalidomide; its approved 
and off-label uses in dermatologic, oncologic, and gastrointestinal conditions; 
and adverse events associated with its use.
METHODS: Relevant articles were identified through searches of MEDLINE 
(1966-June 2002), International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-June 2002), and 
EMBASE (1990-June 2002). Search terms included but were not limited to 
thalidomide, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology, therapeutic use, and 
teratogenicity, as well as terms for specific disease states and adverse events. 
Further publications were identified from the reference lists of the reviewed 
articles. Abstracts of recent symposia were obtained from the American Society 
of Clinical Oncology Web site.
RESULTS: Thalidomide is thought to exert its therapeutic effect through the 
modulation of cytokines, particularly tumor necrosis factor-alpha. In addition 
to its approved indication for ENL, thalidomide has been studied in various 
other conditions, including graft-versus-host disease, discoid lupus 
erythematosus, sarcoidosis, relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma, Waldenstrom's 
macroglobulinemia, myelodysplastic syndromes, acute myeloid leukemia, 
myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia, renal cell carcinoma, malignant gliomas, 
prostate cancer, Kaposi's sarcoma, colorectal carcinoma, oral aphthous ulcers, 
Behçet's disease, Crohn's disease, and HIV/AIDS-associated wasting. Adverse 
events most frequently associated with its use include somnolence, constipation, 
rash, peripheral neuropathy, and thromboembolism.
CONCLUSIONS: Use of thalidomide is limited by toxicity, limited efficacy data, 
and restricted access. Evidence of its efficacy in conditions other than ENL 
awaits the results of controlled clinical trials.

It remains unclear how the immune system affects leukemia development. To 
clarify the significance of the presence of immune systems in leukemia 
development, we transferred MLL/ENL leukemia cells into immune-competent or 
immune-deficient mice without any preconditioning including irradiation. The 
wild-type mice did not develop leukemia, whereas all the Rag2(-/-)γc(-/-) mice 
lacking both adaptive immune cells and natural killer (NK) cells developed 
leukemia, indicating that leukemia cells were immunologically rejected. 
Interestingly, leukemia cells were also rejected in 60% of the Rag2(-/-) mice 
that lacked adaptive immune cells but possessed NK cells, suggesting that NK 
cells play a substantial role in the rejection of leukemia. Moreover, 
engraftment of leukemia cells was enhanced by NK cell depletion in Rag2(-/-) 
recipients and inhibited by transfer of NK cells into Rag2(-/-)γc(-/-) 
recipients. Upregulation of NKG2D (NK group 2, member D) ligands in MLL/ENL 
leukemia cells caused elimination of leukemia cells by NK cells. Finally, we 
found that leukemia cells resistant to elimination by NK cells had been selected 
during leukemia development in Rag2(-/-) recipients. These results demonstrate 
that NK cells can eradicate MLL/ENL leukemia cells in vivo in the absence of 
adaptive immunity, thus suggesting that NK cells can play a potent role in 
immunosurveillance against leukemia.

Mycobacteria are known to induce autoimmune response in the host. Anti-host 
keratrin antibodies (AkAbs) might be responsible for the autoimmune phenomena in 
leprosy patients as majority of leprosy lesions are manifested in the skin and 
occurrence of keratosis is not an uncommon feature. The aim of this study was to 
find out the level of AkAbs in leprosy patients across the spectrum and to 
explore its correlation with the clinical manifestation of the disease. Further, 
mimicking epitopes of keratin and Mycobacterium leprae components were 
characterized. We screened 140 leprosy patients (27 BT, 28 BL, 41 LL, 25 T1R, 19 
ENL), 74 healthy controls (HC) and 3 psoriasis patients as positive control. 
Highest AkAbs level was observed in the psoriasis patients followed by T1R, LL, 
BL, ENL, TT/BT. AkAbs level was significantly (p<0.05) higher in all the groups 
of leprosy patients except TT/BT in comparison to HC. Significant positive 
correlation was found between number of lesions and level of AkAbs in leprosy 
patients. Highest lympho-proliferation for keratin protein was observed in T1R, 
followed by BL/LL, TT/BT, ENL. Lympho-proliferation was significantly (p<0.05) 
higher in all groups of leprosy patients except ENL in comparison to HC. 
Interestingly, it was noted that hyperimmunization of inbred strains of female 
BALB/c mice and rabbit with M. leprae soluble antigen (MLSA) induce higher level 
of AkAbs. The percentage of FoxP3(+) expressing Treg cells (total 
CD4(+)CD25(+)FoxP3(+) andCD4(+)CD25(+hi)FoxP3(+)) in splenocytes and lymph nodes 
of hyperimmunized mice were declined in comparison to control mice. Further, it 
was found that this autoimmune response can be adoptively transferred in naïve 
mice by splenocytes and lymph node cells as well as T cells. Comparative 
molecular characterization between keratin and MLSA noted a 
cross-reactivity/similarity between these two antigens. The cross-reactive 
protein of keratin was found to be in molecular weight range ≈74-51kDa and at pI 
4.5 while the cross-reactive protein of MLSA was found to be in molecular weight 
≈65kDa and at pI 4-4.5. Cross-reactive protein of keratin and MLSA was 
identified and characterized by MALDI-TOF/TOF analysis and Mascot software. It 
was found that the keratin (host protein) which reacted with anti-M. leprae sera 
is cytokeratin-10 and MLSA which reacted with anti-keratin sera is heat shock 
protein 65 (HSP 65). Seven B-cell epitopes of cytokeratin-10 and HSP 65 was 
found to be similar by multiple sequence alignment using ClustalW server and out 
of which 6 B-cell epitopes were found to be on the surface of HSP 65. In 
conclusion, our study provides evidence for the existence of molecular mimicry 
between cytokeratin-10 of keratin (host protein) and 65kDa HSP (groEL2) of M. 
leprae. Presence of heightened CMI response of leprosy patients to keratin and 
positive correlation of AkAbs level with number of lesions of leprosy patients 
showed the clinical evidence for its role in the pathogenesis in leprosy.

Neutrophil recruitment is pivotal to the host defense against microbial 
infection, but it also contributes to the immunopathology of disease. We 
investigated the mechanism of neutrophil recruitment in human infectious disease 
by means of bioinformatic pathways analysis of the gene expression profiles in 
the skin lesions of leprosy. In erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL), which occurs in 
patients with lepromatous leprosy and is characterized by neutrophil 
infiltration in lesions, the most overrepresented biological functional group 
was cell movement, including E-selectin, which was coordinately regulated with 
interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta). In vitro activation of Toll-like receptor 2 
(TLR2), up-regulated in ENL lesions, triggered induction of IL-1beta, which 
together with interferon gamma induced E-selectin expression on and neutrophil 
adhesion to endothelial cells. Thalidomide, an effective treatment for ENL, 
inhibited this neutrophil recruitment pathway. The gene expression profile of 
ENL lesions comprised an integrated pathway of TLR2 and Fc receptor activation, 
neutrophil migration, and inflammation, providing insight into mechanisms of 
neutrophil recruitment in human infectious disease.

Oral zinc therapy in recurrent erythema nodosum leprosum: a clinical study.

Mahajan PM(1), Jadhav VH, Patki AH, Jogaikar DG, Mehta JM.

Author information:

Effect of oral zinc as an immunomodulator was studied clinically in patients 
with recurrent ENL over a period of one year. In this study, 40 leprosy patients 
with chronic ENL, requiring more than 30-40 mg of prednisolone/day for the 
control of their reactions, were given oral zinc sulphate for a period of four 
months, and, marked improvement in the frequency, duration and severity of 
reactions was observed after zinc therapy. Also evident was marked reduction in 
the steroid requirement after oral zinc therapy. It appears that zinc may be a 
good substitute for the present day anti-reaction treatment which is not free 
from disadvantages. Further investigations to know the precise action of zinc on 
immune-system may help to understand the role of zinc therapy and its optimum 
duration.

Rosario, Argentina.

T cells and the theophylline resistant cells (the-r, helper cells) in peripheral 
blood of patients with different forms of leprosy were studied. Active 
lepromatous patients (LL+) showed a significant decrease in T lymphocytes and 
the-r cells. Nevertheless, in LL+ developing a reactional episode of erythema 
nodosum (LL-ENL) a restoration in the level of the-r cells was observed. It is 
concluded that in LL+ patients the depression of T cells and the-r cells 
represents an imbalance in the T-T cellular cooperation with a defective 
cellular immune response. On the other hand, the recovery of the-r cells in 
LL-ENL support the hypothesis of a cell mediated immune mechanism in the 
immunopathology of this reactional episode.

The rheumatic manifestations of leprosy (Hansen disease).

Albert DA, Weisman MH, Kaplan R.

Leprosy is a rare disorder in the United States, yet the rheumatic features of 
the disease appear to be common and frequently are the primary complaint. We 
observed rheumatic syndromes of erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) occurring with 
and without arthritis, a swollen hands syndrome, cutaneous vasculitis, or 
myositis in the majority (15 of 21) of our patients. These syndromes were 
distinctive, sometimes dramatic, and appeared to "mimic" idiopathic rheumatic 
diseases, substantially delaying an accurate diagnosis of leprosy in some 
patients. These complications were the major cause of morbidity in our 21 
patients and became dominant clinical problems requiring additional 
chemotherapy.

Although it is firmly established that endogenous immunity can prevent cancer 
outgrowth, with a range of immunomodulatory strategies reaching clinical use, 
most studies on the topic have been restricted to solid cancers. This applies in 
particular to cancer initiation, where model constraints have precluded 
investigations of immunosurveillance and immunoediting during the multistep 
progression into acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Here, we used a mouse model where 
the chimeric transcription factor MLL-ENL can be conditionally activated in vivo 
as a leukemic "first-hit," which is followed by spontaneous transformation into 
AML. We observed similar disease kinetics regardless of whether AML developed in 
WT or immunocompromised hosts, despite more permissive preleukemic environments 
in the latter. When assessing transformed AML cells from either primary 
immunocompetent or immunocompromised hosts, AML cells from all sources could be 
targets of endogenous immunity. Our data argue against immunoediting in response 
to selective pressure from endogenous immunity as a universal primary 
transformation event in AML.

Cereal Lignans, Natural Compounds of Interest for Human Health?

Zanella I, Biasiotto G, Holm F, di Lorenzo D.

Cereals are suggested to be the most important sources of lignan in the diets of 
western populations. Recent epidemiological studies show that European 
subpopulations in which the major source of lignans are cereals, display lower 
disease frequency regarding metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. The 
biological mechanisms of lignan are several. Beyond their antioxidant and 
anti-inflammatory actions at nutritional doses some lignans regulate the 
activity of specific nuclear receptors (NRs), such as the estrogen receptors 
(ERs), and also NRs that are central switches in glucose and fatty acid 
metabolism such as PPARα, PPARγ and LXRs, highlighting them as selective nuclear 
receptor modulators (SNRMs). These include enterodiol (END) and enterolactone 
(ENL), the metabolites produced by the gut microbiota from food lignans. The 
available knowledge suggests that given some additional research it should be 
possible to make 'function' claims for a regular intake of lignans-rich foods 
related to maintaining a healthy metabolism.

Assessment of information to substantiate a health claim on the prevention of 
prostate cancer by lignans.

Lignans and their in vivo metabolites, especially enterolactone (ENL), have 
attracted substantial interest as potential chemopreventive agents for prostate 
cancer. Preclinical and clinical interventions performed with lignan-rich 
flaxseed that use surrogate biomarkers as endpoints suggest that lignans may 
attenuate prostate carcinogenesis in individuals with increased risk or with 
diagnosed cancer. No unequivocal prostate cancer risk reduction has been found 
for lignans in epidemiological studies, suggesting that lignan concentrations 
found in populations consuming a regular non-supplemented diet are not 
chemopreventive in prostate cancer. Presumably, the main obstacles in assessing 
the efficacy of food lignans is limited knowledge of the serum and tissue lignan 
concentrations required for the putative prevention. Further clinical studies 
performed with the purified compounds are required to substantiate a health 
claim.

Leprosy is a chronic, infectious disease with varied clinical presentations. The 
type 2 lepra reaction / erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) classically involves 
extremities and face. Besides to the classical lesions of type 2 lepra reaction 
sometimes rare findings of vesicular lesions with necroticans may be observed. 
We are reporting a case of lepromatous leprosy with bullous reaction and 
necroticans involving usual sites along with the unusual involvement of oral 
cavity, which on first look mimicked necrotizing vasculitis or other bullous 
disorders. This manifestation of type 2 lepra reaction in oral mucosa should be 
kept in mind by the physicians while dealing with a case of type 2 lepra 
reaction.

A spiro ent-clerodane homodimer with a rare 6/6/6/6/6-fused pentacyclic 
scaffold, spiroarborin (1), together with four new monomeric analogues (2-5), 
were isolated from Callicarpa arborea. Their structures were elucidated by 
comprehensive spectroscopic data analysis, quantum-chemical calculations, and 
X-ray diffraction. A plausible biosynthetic pathway of 1 was proposed, and a 
biomimetic synthesis of its derivative was accomplished. Compound 1 showed a 
potent inhibitory effect by directly binding to the YEATS domain of the 11-19 
leukemia (ENL) protein with an IC50 value of 7.3 μM. This gave a KD value of 5.0 
μM, as recorded by a surface plasmon resonance binding assay.

Enterolactone (ENL) is produced by the gut microflora from lignans found in 
edible plants. ENL is estrogenic with no effect on the E-screen test and is a 
natural Selected Estrogen Receptor Modulator (SERM) with health interests that 
have to be checked in clinical studies with bioavailability assessment. Two 
haptens of ENL were synthesized, with a spacer arm at the C5 position having 
either 2 or 4 carbon atoms (ENLΔ2 and ENLΔ4, respectively). Hapten coupling to 
bovine serum albumin (BSA) was characterized by MALDI mass spectrometry. 
Polyclonal antibodies were obtained against the BSA conjugates. Additional 
conjugates were generated by coupling to swine thyroglobulin (Thyr). Homologous 
and heterologous competitive ELISAs were developed with Thyr or BSA conjugates 
as coating. The best assays were validated on biological samples from mice. Both 
antibodies exhibited the same IC50 at 1.5 ng mL(-1) with a detection limit below 
0.5 ng mL(-1). Most cross-reactions with structurally related lignans were lower 
than 0.03%. This new assay type is faster, more specific and more reliable than 
existing ones.

The sedative/hypnotic thalidomide was withdrawn from the worldwide market nearly 
40 years ago, because of its teratogenic and neurotoxic effects. Thalidomide was 
later found to very effectively suppress erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL). The US 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Thalomid (thalidomide) capsules 
for the acute treatment of the cutaneous manifestations of moderate to severe 
ENL. Thalidomide is currently under investigation for the treatment of a wide 
variety of diseases, including conditions thought to have an inflammatory or 
immune basis, malignancies and complications of infection with HIV. Interest in 
the potential anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory and anti- angiogenic effects 
of thalidomide has resulted in off-label use of prescription thalidomide. During 
the first 18 months of spontaneous postmarketing adverse event surveillance for 
Thalomid, 1210 spontaneous postmarketing adverse event reports were received for 
patients treated with prescription thalidomide for all therapeutic indications, 
including off-label use. The most common adverse events spontaneously reported 
would have been expected on the basis of the current Thalomid labelling/product 
information. The current labelling/product information reflects what was known 
about the risks associated with thalidomide therapy in limited patient 
populations at the time of the approval of Thalomid. With the postmarketing use 
of thalidomide in populations other than patients with ENL, it becomes 
increasingly important to identify patient groups that may be particularly 
susceptible to specific adverse drug effects and to identify conditions under 
which specific adverse events may be more likely to occur. Oncology patients may 
represent a patient population with increased susceptibility to 
thalidomide-associated adverse effects, including thromboembolic events. 
Consideration of the spontaneous postmarketing safety surveillance data may help 
to identify and characterise factors associated with increased risk in this and 
other patient groups. Serious unexpected adverse events reported with sufficient 
frequency to signal previously undetected product-event associations for which 
there may potentially be plausible evidence to suggest a causal relationship 
have included seizures and Stevens-Johnson syndrome. The potential effects of 
thalidomide on wound healing are also being closely monitored. Premarketing 
human clinical trials of drug products are inherently limited in their ability 
to detect adverse events. Broader postmarketing experience with thalidomide in 
more varied patient populations and more experience in the setting of long term 
thalidomide use will increase our ability to detect rare adverse events and to 
identify signals that may need to be evaluated in more controlled settings.

Type 2 lepra reaction (or erythema nodosum leprosum [ENL]) is an immune 
complex-mediated reaction which has been reported to occur for up to 8 years 
after successful completion of multibacillary multidrug therapy. The management 
of ENL is a challenge with the patient often becoming steroid dependent; 
predisposing to recurrent episodes in 39%-77% of cases on attempted steroid 
withdrawal. Here, we present a case of recalcitrant recurrent type 2 reaction 
which responded promptly to treatment with colchicine.

Type 2 lepra reaction or erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) is an immune complex 
syndrome that occurs mostly in lepromatous leprosy and sometimes in borderline 
lepromatous leprosy patients. We present an untreated case of lepromatous 
leprosy, who presented with type 2 lepra reaction and livedo reticularis. Livedo 
reticularis, though seen in lucio phenomenon, is not a part of type 2 lepra 
reaction. The case is being reported for its rarity.

Introductory rifampicin therapy in lepromatous leprosy: a six month follow-up 
study.

Girdhar BK, Ramu G, Sreevatsa, Desikan KV.

A double-blind comparative trial of 300 mg of Rifampicin given daily as against 
50 mg D.D.S. administered likewise for an initial period of 3 months has been 
undertaken on 24 untreated cases of lepromatous leprosy. All the patients have 
been followed up for 6 months. The results revealed that patients in the former 
group became non-infective, as concluded from M.I. and mouse foot-pad results, 
within 3-4 weeks and their nasal ulcers healed faster. Clinical improvement was 
slightly better in the former group while no bacteriological differences were 
noticed in the two groups. E.N.L. was milder and slightly less common in the 
Rifampicin group.

Clinical trial of DADDS in lepromatous leprosy.

Ganapati R, Naik SS, Shah MH, Shirsat LS, Gaitonde BB.

This presentation reports the results of a short clinical trial with DADDS in 23 
patients of lepromatous leprosy. Injections of DADDS administered 
intramuscularly in a dose of 225 mg every 70 days produced clinical regression 
noticeable earliest at few week after the secondn injection. A fall in the 
morphological index from 5.0 to 0.6 was observed in patients who had received 
from 3 to 7 injections. Erythema nodosum leprosum was encountered in 7 cases, 
four of which had moderate to severe grades of reaction. It is advisible to 
discontinue further injection of DADDS if initial signs of ENL are noticed, 
which are likely to occur after the second injection. These ENL responded well 
to the usual line of antireaction treatment. DDS level in blood was found to be 
more than 10 ng/ml before the fresh administration of DADDS upto the seventh 
injection, representing the period of follow-up in this study.

Thalidomide in type-2 lepra reaction--a clinical experience.

Jadhav VH(1), Patki AH, Mehta JM.

Author information:
(1)Dr. Bandorawala Leprosy Hospital, Pune.

A clinical experience of using thalidomide in type-2 lepra reaction (ENL) in 90 
male patients--57 with lepromatous leprosy (LL) and 33 with borderline 
lepromatous leprosy (BL)--is described. All the patients responded well although 
some took a longer time to improve. No major side effects were observed except 
for giddiness in 10 and gastrointestinal upsets in 7 patients. Thalidomide thus 
appears to be a very effective drug in the treatment of severe type-2 lepra 
reaction and apart from its historically well-documented embryopathic effects, 
does not seem to have any other serious side effects in the patients under 
study.

The effect of E-N-L-trimethyllysine (TML) on the humoral and cellular immune 
response.

Elek G, Láng I, Szende B, Lapis K.

E-N-L-Trimethyllysine glutamate (TML) influences the humoral and cellular immune 
response of mice. Chronic pre- and post-treatment (100 mg/kg/day, 5 times) 
transitionally increased the anti-SRBC haemagglutinin titre of female CBA mice. 
After 400 r whole body irradiation, TML treatment accelerated the normalization 
of the haemagglutinin level. TML treatment prolonged the life-span of BDF1 
hybrid mice that had first been immunized and then inoculated with L1210 cells. 
TML diminished the delayed type hypersensitivity reaction in vivo of irradiated 
and non-irradiated CBA female mice and dose-dependent decreased the spontaneous 
(SLMC) and antibody-dependent (ADCC) cytotoxicity of healthy human lymphocytes, 
in vitro. As a low molecular weight immunomodulant, TML may also be considered 
as a therapeutic tool.

During pregnancy, human exposure to endogenous estrogens and xenoestrogens (such 
as lignans) may comprehensively impact the gestational maintenance and fetal 
growth. We measured the concentrations of 5 lignans and the profile of 13 
estrogen metabolites (EMs) in the urine samples of 328 pregnant women and 
examined their associations with birth outcomes. We found significantly positive 
associations between gestational age and urinary matairesinol (MAT), enterodiol 
(END) and enterolactone (ENL), as well as 16-hydroxylation pathway EMs. There 
were consistently positive relationships between END and the 16-hydroxylation 
pathway EMs. The positive relationships of MAT, END and ENL exposures with the 
length of gestation were mainly in the low exposure strata of the levels of 
these EMs. This study reveals that MAT, END and ENL as well as 16-hydroxylation 
pathway EMs are associated with birth outcomes, and that there are interactive 
relationships between lignans and 16-hydroxylation pathway EMs with birth 
outcomes.

Leprosy is characterized by spectrum of histologically different granulomatous 
skin lesions that reflects the patient's immune response to Mycobacterium 
leprae. Presence, frequency, and distribution of both CD4+ CD25+ FoxP3+ T 
regulatory cells (T-regs) and CD123+ plasmacytoid dendritic cells in leprosy 
have never been investigated. We performed a retrospective immunohistochemical 
study on 20 cases of leprosy [tuberculoid tuberculoid (TT): 1 patient; 
borderline tuberculoid (BT): 3 patients; borderline lepromatous (BL): 5 
patients; lepromatous lepromatous (LL): 5 patients; borderline borderline in 
reversal reaction (BB-RR): 1 patient; BT-RR: 2 patients; and erythema nodosum 
leprosum (ENL): 3 patients]. FoxP3-positive cells were present in 95% of the 
cases with an average density of 2.9% of the infiltrate. Their distribution was 
not related to granulomatous structures or special locations. There was no 
statistical difference of FoxP3 expression between TT, BT, BL, and LL, whereas a 
statistical significant increment (P = 0.042) was observed in patients affected 
by reversal leprosy reactions (BT-RR and BB-RR) compared with patients affected 
by ENL and patients with nonreactional disease forms (BL, LL, BT, TT). CD123 
expression was not observed in any of the biopsy specimens evaluated; with the 
exception of 2 cases of ENL, in which a focal positivity for CD123 was observed. 
Our results show that plasmacytoid dendritic cells are not involved in the 
immune response against M. leprae while T-regs are present in leprosy skin 
lesions. These data raise the question if T-regs have a pathogenetic role in HD 
as previously demonstrated in Leishmania major and Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

Thalidomide inhibited the synthesis of IgM and IgG whereas 
Thalidomide+Dexamethasone and Dexamethasone alone acted as co-stimulants with 
pokeweed and enhanced their synthesis.

Thalidomide (Thal) provides effective treatment for erythema nodosum leprosum 
(ENL). In combination with Dexamethasome (Dex) it is an effective treatment for 
multiple myeloma (MM) and Waldenström's macroglobulinemia (WM). Thal's 
mechanism(s) of action in the treatment of these diverse medical conditions is 
not known, but it could be suppression of immunoglobulin (Ig) synthesis. 
Mononuclear cells were stimulated with pokeweed (PWM), and treated with Thal, 
Thal+Dex or Dex. The cultures were assayed for IgM and IgG. The maximum 
synthesis was expected to occur in cultures stimulated with PWM at 0.5, 5.0 or 
10 microg/ml. The test agents at 15 microM each were expected to alter the 
response. Compared to cultures stimulated with PWM alone, there was 
significantly less Ig in the cultures containing Thal+PWM, and significantly 
more Ig in the cultures containing Thal+Dex+PWM or Dex+PWM (Wilcoxon). The 
median % of maximum was 57 for cultures treated with Thal+PWM; 184 for cultures 
treated with Thal+Dex+PWM, and 139 for cultures treated with Dex+PWM. Thal also 
acted as a co-stimulant with PWM and enhanced the synthesis of IL-2, IL-6 and 
DNA; whereas, Thal+Dex or Dex enhanced Ig synthesis, but suppressed IL-2, IL-6 
and cell proliferation. Thal's ability to suppress Ig may explain its activity 
in ENL, MM and WM. The enhancement of Ig by Dex does not help to explain a role 
for Dex alone or in combination with Thal for the treatment of MM and WM.

In situ identification of activated Ta1+ T lymphocytes in human leprosy skin 
lesions.

Using a monoclonal antibody, anti-Ta1, that identifies antigen-activated T 
lymphocytes in vitro, we sought to identify activated T lymphocytes in leprosy 
skin lesions. Greater numbers of Ta1 positive T lymphocytes were observed in 
tuberculoid leprosy, lepromin skin tests, and reversal reactions as compared 
with lepromatous leprosy or erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) (p less than 0.001). 
With a double-staining technique, we found that the majority of these activated 
T lymphocytes were of the helper/inducer phenotype. No differences of Ta1 
positive lymphocytes were observed in the peripheral blood. The defective 
cell-mediated immune response in lepromatous and ENL patients correlates with, 
and may be related to the failure of T-helper/inducer activation or 
proliferation in the presence of Mycobacterium leprae.

Rare atypical presentations in Type 2 lepra reaction: a case series.

Vijendran P(1), Verma R, Vasudevan B, Mitra D, Badad A, Neema S.

OBJECTIVES: Type 2 lepra reaction is a Th2-mediated type III hypersensitivity 
reaction in leprosy, with a characteristic cutaneous manifestation in the form 
of erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL). We describe unusual presentations of Type 2 
lepra reaction in five patients.
METHODS: Patient data and dermatological findings were analyzed in three men and 
two women diagnosed with Hansen's disease.
RESULTS: Findings included multiple tender, polycyclic, necrotic lesions 
distributed over the face in one patient, and painful, fluid-filled lesions on 
both arms and lower limbs in another. The third patient showed erythematous, 
tender nodules, bullae, and necrotic ulcers over the back and upper and lower 
limbs. The fourth showed erythematous tender nodules over the face, neck, back, 
and extremities, predominantly in sun-exposed areas. The fifth revealed multiple 
erythematous, severely tender nodules and urticarial plaques mimicking those of 
Sweet's syndrome. Diagnosis of borderline or lepromatous leprosy with atypical 
Type 2 reaction were made in all cases.
CONCLUSIONS: Type 2 lepra reactions are antigen antibody-mediated immune complex 
reactions that present with constitutional symptoms and ENL characterized by 
tender, erythematous, evanescent nodules mainly on the face, arms, and legs. 
Over 50% of lepromatous leprosy patients and 25% of borderline lepromatous 
leprosy patients experienced type 2 lepra reactions prior to the advent of 
multi-drug therapy. Thalidomide is the drug of choice for severe atypical lepra 
reactions because of its anti-tumor necrosis factor-α action. Awareness of these 
atypical variants and prompt diagnosis and treatment are essential to prevent 
mortality and morbidity in potentially treatable patients.

Differences in predominant T cell phenotypes and distribution pattern in 
reactional lesions of tuberculoid and lepromatous leprosy.

Narayanan RB, Laal S, Sharma AK, Bhutani LK, Nath I.

The nature and histological pattern of the cutaneous infiltrates of 17 leprosy 
patients in reversal reactions (Type I) and erythema nodosum leprosum (Type II, 
ENL) were compared with tissues from 18 non-reactional borderline leprosy (BT, 
BL) and lepromatous leprosy (LL) patients using monoclonal antibodies and 
immunofluorescence. Reactional BT lesions showed a mild increase in OKT11+ pan T 
cells as compared to non-reactional tissues and a significant influx of OKT8+ 
(suppressor/cytotoxic) cells which were peripherally localized in the lymphocyte 
mantle surrounding the epithelioid cells. The Leu 3a+ (helper/inducer) cells 
were scattered amongst the lymphocytes and macrophages. The mean ratio (+/- 
s.d.) of Leu 3a+/OKT8+ cells was 1.88 +/- 0.64 in Type I BT reactions as 
compared to 2.95 +/- 0.95 in BT lesions. In contrast, lesions of BL reversal 
reactions and ENL showed a more marked increase in pan T cells with a 
preponderance of the helper/inducer subset, Leu 3a+/OKT8+ ratio being 2.26 +/- 
0.61 and 0.93 +/- 0.57 in BL reactional and non-reactional lesions, 
respectively. Interestingly, this increase in the numbers of the T cells reached 
levels observed in BT lesions. The distribution pattern of OKT8+ cells was 
similar to Leu 3a+, both being diffusely scattered amongst the bacilli laden 
macrophages. Ia like antigens were present in all granulomas and were abundant 
on lymphocytes and macrophages and less conspicuous on epithelioid cells. T6+ 
Langerhans cells were uniformly increased in all reactional lesions. It would 
appear that the changes observed in both Type I and Type II reactions are 
similar in the lepromatous group of patients. They differ significantly from the 
BT reversal reaction in terms of the dominant T cell subset and the 
microanatomical distribution of the OKT8+ cells in the lesions.

Though patients affected with both acquired immuno deficiency syndrome (AIDS) 
and leprosy commonly present with type 1 lepra reaction, there are few isolated 
reports of type 2 lepra reaction in retropositive patients affected with 
leprosy. We are presenting a case report of 35-year-old male affected with AIDS, 
tubercular lymphadenitis, and lepromatous leprosy with recurrent episodes of 
type 2 lepra reaction manifesting as erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL). Dipstick 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for filarial antigen was also 
positive. The patient was treated with 100 mg thalidomide daily, 300 mg 
diethylcarbamazine, and modified multidrug therapy (MDT) for leprosy. He 
responded well and has not had any further reaction in the last 6 months.

The nanoscale geometry and topography of the extra-cellular matrix (ECM) is an 
important parameter controlling cell adhesion and phenotype. Similarly, integrin 
expression and the geometrical maturation of adhesions they regulate have been 
correlated with important changes in cell spreading and phenotype. However, how 
integrin expression controls the nanoscale sensing of the ECM geometry is not 
clearly understood. Here we develop a new nanopatterning technique, electrospun 
nanofiber lithography (ENL), which allows the production of a quasi-2D fibrous 
nanopattern with controlled dimensions (250-1000nm) and densities. ENL relies on 
electrospun fibres to act as a mask for the controlled growth of 
protein-resistant polymer brushes. SEM, AFM and immunofluorescence imaging were 
used to characterise the resulting patterns and the adsorption of the 
extra-cellular matrix protein fibronectin to the patterned fibres. The control 
of adhesion formation was studied, as well as the remodelling and deposition of 
novel matrix. Cell spreading was found to be regulated by the size of fibres, 
similarly to previous observations made on circular nanopatterns. However, cell 
shape and polarity were more significantly affected. These changes correlated 
with important cytoskeleton reorganisation, with a gradual decrease in stress 
fibre formation as the pattern dimensions decrease. Finally, the differential 
expression of αvβ3 and α5β1 integrins in engineered cell lines was found to be 
an important mediator of cell sensing of the nanoscale geometry of the ECM.
STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: The novel nanofiber patterns developed in this study, 
via ENL, mimic the geometry and continuity of natural matrices found in the 
stroma of tissues, whilst preserving a quasi-2D character (to facilitate imaging 
and for comparison with other 2D systems such as micropatterned monolayers and 
circular nanopatches generated by colloidal lithography). These results 
demonstrate that the nanoscale geometry of the ECM plays an important role in 
regulating cell adhesion and that this is modulated by integrin expression. This 
is an important finding as it implies that the knowledge of the biochemical 
context underlying the integrin-mediated adhesive machinery of specific cell 
types should allow better design of biomaterials and biointerfaces. Indeed, 
changes in integrin expression are often associated with the control of cell 
proliferation and differentiation.

The distressing consequences of immunology in leprosy is the lepra reaction. 
Erythema nodosum leprosum(ENL) in special cases need to be managed with capsule 
thalidomide in varying doses. We report such a case of bradycardia in 
thalidomide dose dependent manner in a young ENL male.

A Traditional NSAID Aspirin along with Clofazimine in Erythema Nodosum Leprosum 
Reaction: Study of Six Cases.

Sharma PK, Singh DK.

Six male patients of lepromatous leprosy with erythema nodosum leprosum reaction 
(ENL) reactions diagnosed clinically and by slit skin smear were treated with 
aspirin and clofazimine. Aspirin was given in the daily dosage of 75mg/kg body 
weight up to a maximum of 2.8 grams in four divided doses, along with daily 
300mg clofazimine in three divided doses and dapsone 100mg daily with rifampicin 
600mg once a month. Aspirin was continued in the same dosage for a month before 
being tapered and stopped at the end of third month when clofazimine was also 
reduced to 50 mg daily. All the six cases had an excellent response in 15 days.

leprosy.

We analysed specific IgG subclasses levels to Mycobacterium leprae sonicate 
extract (MSE), lipoarabinomannan B (LAM) and phenolic glycolipid I (PGL-I) in 
the sera of leprosy patients with different clinical manifestations. IgG2 was 
found to be the predominant antibody to MSE regardless of clinical 
manifestations, and IgG1 response was mostly seen in lepromatous patients. IgG3 
reacted only rarely but IgG4 reacted relatively more in certain clinical groups 
such as borderline lepromatous and lepromatous with erythema nodosum leprosum 
(ENL) reaction. Most of the IgG subclass responses to MSE could be accounted for 
reactivity with LAM, suggesting that LAM is the major immunogen involved in the 
pathogenesis of leprosy. In contrast to LAM, PGL-I antigen showed considerably 
lower reactivities for IgG subclasses. An association between IgG subclass 
responses and clinical manifestations of leprosy was also seen. Whereas 
borderline lepromatous patients were found to have significantly higher levels 
of IgG2 and IgG4 to MSE, lepromatous patients had elevated levels of IgG1 and 
lower levels of IgG2. An interesting observation, however, was the significantly 
higher levels of IgG2 to LAM in the pure neuritic leprosy patients.

Urolithiasis commonly affects cats and dogs. The American College of Veterinary 
Internal Medicine established guidelines for the treatment of uroliths that 
reflect modern techniques prioritizing minimally invasive procedures with an 
emphasis on prevention strategies to limit morbidity and mortality. 
Extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy and endoscopic nephrolithotomy constitute 
some of the minimally invasive treatment modalities available for upper urinary 
tract uroliths. Cystoscopic-guided basket retrieval, cystoscopic-guided laser 
lithotripsy, and percutaneous cystolithotomy are minimally invasive options for 
the management of lower urinary tract uroliths. Following stone removal, 
prevention strategies are essential to help reduce morbidity and mortality 
associated with stone recurrence.

Effect of levamisole on clinical outcome and DNCB conversion in leprosy 
patients. A long term study.

Yagnik CS, Jogaikar DG, Mehta JM.

Fifteen patients of lepromatous leprosy within first 6 months of diagnosis were 
studied. 7 controls received standard DDS treatment and placebo while 8 patients 
received cyclical levamisole treatment (150 mg daily for 3 days repeated after a 
gap of 2 weeks), in addition to standard DDS treatment. Patients were followed 
up clinically for lepra reactions, serial B.I. and DNCB test for 2 years. We 
observed that ENL reactions were more common and more severe in levamisole 
treated group while an upgrading type reaction occurred only in one of the 
control patients. B I. remained same in both groups throughout, while DNCB score 
was higher in control rather than levamisole treated groups. Thus, levamisole 
treatment does not seem to have caused stimulation of CMI in our patients as 
judged by DNCB reaction while it may have caused stimulation of humoral immunity 
as seen by higher incidence of ENL reaction. This may be undesirable in 
lepromatous patients.

Leukemic oncoproteins cause uncontrolled self-renewal of hematopoietic 
progenitors by aberrant gene activation, eventually causing leukemia. However, 
the molecular mechanism underlying aberrant gene activation remains elusive. 
Here, we showed that leukemic MLL fusion proteins associate with the HBO1 
histone acetyltransferase (HAT) complex through their trithorax homology domain 
2 (THD2) in various human cell lines. MLL proteins associated with the HBO1 
complex through multiple contacts mediated mainly by the ING4/5 and PHF16 
subunits in a chromatin-bound context where histone H3 lysine 4 tri-methylation 
marks were present. Of the many MLL fusions, MLL-ELL particularly depended on 
the THD2-mediated association with the HBO1 complex for leukemic transformation. 
The C-terminal portion of ELL provided a binding platform for multiple factors 
including AF4, EAF1, and p53. MLL-ELL activated gene expression in murine 
hematopoietic progenitors by loading an AF4/ENL/P-TEFb (AEP) complex onto the 
target promoters wherein the HBO1 complex promoted the association with AEP 
complex over EAF1 and p53. Moreover, the NUP98-HBO1 fusion protein exerted its 
oncogenic properties via interaction with MLL but not its intrinsic HAT 
activity. Thus, the interaction between the HBO1 complex and MLL is an important 
nexus in leukemic transformation, which may serve as a therapeutic target for 
drug development.

Chromatin readers are important intermediaries linking epigenetic information 
and biological phenotypes. Many diseases are caused by mutations in epigenetic 
readers. Recently, a study by Wan et al. uncovered that cancer-associated 
mutations promote self-association of eleven-nineteen-leukemia protein (ENL), 
leading to abnormal condensates, elevated gene expression, and impaired cell 
fate determination.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to evaluate the role of PET-CT in 
identification of different patterns of extranodal involvement in Hodgkin's 
disease (HD) and Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL) and to enlist the common sites of 
extranodal involvement in each histological type and compare our results with 
the existing literature.
METHODS: In this retrospective study of 281 cases of lymphomas of various 
histologies, we illustrate the spectrum of PET/CT features of extranodal 
lymphoma (ENL) of commonly involved organs and compare our result with the 
literature.
RESULT: Extranodal appearance in lymphoma is strikingly varied. Diffuse large B 
cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the commonest histological subtype and gastrointestinal 
tract is the commonest anatomical subsite in NHL. Skeletal system is the 
commonest site for involvement in HD.
CONCLUSION: A broad spectrum of extranodal organs is involved in various subtype 
of lymphoma which can be depicted in PET-CT in the most appropriate manner. 
Familiarity with the pattern of involvement is essential for comprehensive 
management.

[Developmental aspects of the Rubino reaction].

[Article in Portuguese]

Opromolla DV, Arruda MS, Ura S, Pernambuco JC, Bastazini I, Fleury RN, Tolentino 
MM, Tonello CJ, Arruda OS.

The Rubino reaction was studied in 178 leprosy patients to correlate its 
positivity, clinical form, E.N.L., and time and activity of the disease. The 
patients studied were classified according to the criteria established by the 
1953 Madrid Congress. The results show that the tuberculoid patients presented 
negative Rubino reactions regardless of any of the parameters studied. The 
borderline patients showed 9% positive Rubino reaction not related to any of the 
observed parameters studied. The lepromatous patients showed a significant 
difference of positivity to the Rubino reaction when grouped as to the disease's 
active or non-active presence. Active lepromatous patients showed 55% of 
positivity to the Rubino reaction whereas patients considered clinically 
inactive showed only 6% of positivity. The fact that the Rubino reaction is 
negative in the majority of patients who are clinically cured would indicate 
that this test could be included as part of the criteria used in determining 
which clinically cured lepromatous patients can discontinue medication without 
risking a relapse.

YEATS domains are newly identified epigenetic "readers" of histone lysine 
acetylation (Kac) and crotonylation (Kcr). The malfunction of YEATS-Kac/Kcr 
interactions has been found to be involved in the pathogenesis of human 
diseases, such as cancer. These discoveries suggest that the YEATS domains are 
promising novel drug targets. We and others recently reported the development of 
YEATS domain inhibitors. Although these inhibitors have a general preference 
toward the AF9 and ENL YEATS domains, selective inhibitors targeting either 
YEATS domain are challenging to develop as these two proteins share a high 
structural similarity. In this study, we identified a proximal site outside the 
acyllysine-binding pocket that can differentiate AF9 YEATS from ENL YEATS. 
Combinatorial targeting of both the acyllysine pocket and this additional site 
by conformationally preorganized cyclopeptides enabled the selective inhibition 
of the AF9 YEATS domain. The most selective inhibitor, JYX-3, showed a 38-fold 
higher binding affinity toward AF9 YEATS over ENL YEATS. Further investigations 
indicated that JYX-3 could engage with AF9 in living cells, disrupt the 
YEATS-dependent chromatin recruitment of AF9, and suppress the transcription of 
AF9 target genes.

Inflammatory processes associated with the over-production of cytokines, 
particularly of TNF-alpha, accompany numerous neurodegenerative diseases, such 
as Alzheimer's disease, in addition to numerous systemic conditions, exemplified 
by rheumatoid arthritis and erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL). TNF-alpha has been 
validated as a drug target with Remicade and Enbrel available as prescription 
medications. Both, however, are large macromolecules, require injection and have 
limited brain access. The classical drug, thalidomide is being increasingly used 
in the clinical management of a wide spectrum of diseases. As its clinical value 
in treating ENL derives from its TNF-alpha inhibitory activity, thalidomide was 
chosen for structural modification for the discovery of novel and more potent 
isosteric analogues with appropriate lipophilicity to insure high brain 
penetration. TNF-alpha inhibitory activity was evaluated against 
lipopolysacharide (LPS) stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in 
cell culture, whose viability was quantified to differentiate reductions in 
TNF-alpha secretion from that associated with cellular toxicity. Specific 
analogues potently inhibited TNF-alpha secretion, compared to thalidomide. This 
involved a post-transcriptional mechanism, as they decreased TNF-alpha mRNA 
stability via its 3'-untranslated region (UTR), as determined by luciferase 
activity in stably transfected cells with and without the 3'-UTR of human 
TNF-alpha.

MLL/ENL fusion in congenital acute lymphoblastic leukemia with a unique 
t(11;18;19).

Hamburg, Germany.

To elucidate the events leading to a unique complex translocation involving 
chromosomes 11, 18, and 19 in a congenital progenitor B-cell acute lymphoblastic 
leukemia, we have performed comprehensive cytogenetic and fluorescence in situ 
hybridization (FISH) analyses as well as molecular genetic studies on the DNA 
and RNA level. We were able to confirm the cytogenetic interpretation of this 
complex t(11;18;19)(q23;q22;p13.3) by chromosome painting. Involvement of the 
MLL gene on 11q23 became evident by Southern blot analysis as well as by FISH 
with a YAC clone containing the respective gene. Despite the fact that the 
additional signals of the split YAC clone were observed on the abnormal 
chromosome 18, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) revealed 
a MLL/ENL hybrid mRNA, which is specific for a t(11;19)(q23;p13.3). This gene 
fusion most probably represents the critical part of this rearrangement. The 
transfer of the translocated part of the split YAC clone onto chromosome 18 
indicates that the second break must have occurred in the vicinity of the first 
one, at a distance too close to be resolved by FISH. Whether this break took 
place within chromosome 11 or 19 sequences, up- or downstream of the MLL/ENL 
fusion, and whether this translocation results from a concerted simultaneous 
exchange of material or from two separate sequential events in consecutive cell 
generations remains open.

Leprosy Reactions Show Increased Th17 Cell Activity and Reduced FOXP3+ Tregs 
with Concomitant Decrease in TGF-β and Increase in IL-6.

BACKGROUND: 50% of leprosy patients suffer from episodes of Type 1/ reversal 
reactions (RR) and Type 2/ Erythema Nodosum Leprosum (ENL) reactions which lead 
to morbidity and nerve damage. CD4+ subsets of Th17 cells and CD25+FOXP3+ 
regulatory T cells (Tregs) have been shown to play a major role in disease 
associated immunopathology and in stable leprosy as reported by us and others. 
The aim of our study was to analyze their role in leprosy reactions.
METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPLE FINDINGS: Quantitative reverse transcribed PCR (qPCR), 
flowcytometry and ELISA were used to respectively investigate gene expression, 
cell phenotypes and supernatant levels of cytokines in antigen stimulated PBMC 
cultures in patients with stable disease and those undergoing leprosy reactions. 
Both types of reactions are associated with significant increase of Th17 cells 
and associated cytokines IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-21, IL-23 and chemokines CCL20, 
CCL22 as compared to matching stable forms of leprosy. Concurrently patients in 
reactions show reduction in FOXP3+ Treg cells as well as reduction in TGF-β and 
increase in IL-6. Moreover, expression of many T cell markers, cytokines, 
chemokines and signaling factors were observed to be increased in RR as compared 
to ENL reaction patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with leprosy reactions show an imbalance in Th17 and Treg 
populations. The reduction in Treg suppressor activity is associated 
withhigherTh17cell activity. The combined effect of reduced TGF-β and enhanced 
IL-6, IL-21 cytokines influence the balance between Th17 or Treg cells in 
leprosy reactions as reported in the murine models and autoimmune diseases. The 
increase in Th17 cell associated cytokines may contribute to lesional 
inflammation.

Estimation of serum level of interleukin-17 and interleukin-4 in leprosy, 
towards more understanding of leprosy immunopathogenesis.

Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt.

BACKGROUND: Combating Mycobacterium leprae is known to be via T-helper1 
response. However, other T-helper effector cells; T-helper17 and T-helper2; play 
a role, particularly in the context of disease type.
AIMS: We aimed to evaluate serum levels of interleukin (IL)-17 (T-helper17 
cytokine) and IL-4 (T-helper2 cytokine) in untreated patients with different 
types of leprosy, compared to controls.
METHODS: Using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, serum IL-17 and IL-4 levels 
were estimated in 43 leprotic patients and 43 controls. Patients were divided 
into six groups; tuberculoid, borderline cases, lepromatous, erythema nodosum 
leprosum (ENL), type 1 reactional leprosy, and pure neural leprosy. Patients 
were also categorized according to bacillary load and the presence or absence of 
reactions.
RESULTS: Serum IL-17 was significantly lower in cases (4-61.5 pg/mL; median 19), 
compared to controls (26-55 pg/mL; median 36) (P < 0.001), and was significantly 
lower in each type of leprosy compared to controls, with the lowest level in 
lepromatous leprosy (4-61.5 pg/mL; median 12.5). Significantly elevated serum 
IL-4 was found in patients (1.31-122.4 pg/mL; median 2.31) compared to controls 
(1.45-5.72 pg/mL; median 2.02) (P = 0.008), with the highest level among 
lepromatous leprosy patients (2-87.2 pg/mL; median 28.9), and the lowest in type 
1 reactional leprosy (1.4-2.5 pg/mL; median 1.87) (P = 0.006).
CONCLUSION: Defective secretion of IL-17 is related to disease acquisition as 
well as progression toward lepromatous pole in leprosy patients. The 
overproduction of IL-4 in patients with lepromatous leprosy may infer their 
liability to develop ENL. Nevertheless, the small number of the studied 
population is a limitation.

Bobigny, France.

OBJECTIVE: Estimation of dietary intake of polyphenols is difficult, due to 
limited availability of food composition data and bias inherent to dietary 
assessment methods. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether we 
could detect polyphenols and their metabolites in a spot urine sample in a 
free-living human population and whether it was related to those observed in 
24-h urine samples, for potential use as a biomarkers of polyphenol intake.
SUBJECTS: Four 24-h urine samples and two spot urine samples were collected from 
154 participants of the SU.VI.MAX cohort (a randomized primary-prevention trial 
evaluating the effect of daily antioxidant supplementation on chronic diseases) 
in two separate studies over, respectively, a 7- and 2-day periods. Thirteen 
polyphenols and metabolites (chlorogenic acid (CGA), caffeic acid (CA), 
m-coumaric acid (mCOU), gallic acid (GA), 4-O-methylgallic acid (MeGA), 
quercetin (Q), isorhamnetin (MeQ), kaempferol (K), hesperetin (HESP), naringenin 
(NAR), phloretin (PHLOR), enterolactone (ENL) and enterodiol (END) were measured 
using HPLC-ESI-MS-MS.
RESULTS: Correlations between the urinary excretion levels were observed. The 
most significant were explained by metabolic filiations (CGA/CA, CA/mCOU, 
GA/MeGA, Q/MeQ, NAR/PHLOR, ENL/END) or co-occurrence in a same food source 
(NAR/HESP). Concentrations in spot samples correlated with those in 24-h urine 
sample (P<0.02, except for CA and for MeQ). Intra-individual variations were 
smaller than inter-individual variations for all polyphenols (P<0.01) except for 
MeGA and for PHLOR.
CONCLUSION: These results show that these polyphenols and metabolites are useful 
biomarkers for polyphenol intake.

Whole-grain rye and wheat products are rich in lignans, the precursors of 
enterolactone (ENL) and alkylresorcinols (ARs), which are phenolic lipids. In 
this crossover trial, we examined the effect of whole-grain rye bread compared 
with low-fiber wheat bread on plasma AR levels. Women (n = 39) aged 59 +/- 0.94 
y (mean +/- SEM) were advised to consume rye (214 +/- 7.1 g/d) or wheat (178 +/- 
6.5 g/d) bread (20% of total daily energy intake) in random order for 8 wk. The 
test periods were separated by an 8-wk washout period. ARs with different 
homologues and ENL were measured in plasma collected at the beginning (habitual 
diet) and end of the test bread periods. AR concentrations were higher (P < 
0.001) after the rye bread (352 +/- 24.7 nmol/L) and habitual diet (97.7 +/- 
12.1 and 88.3 +/- 8.7 nmol/L) periods than after the wheat bread period (36.6 
+/- 4.2 nmol/L). Plasma AR concentrations were correlated with intake of rye 
bread (r = 0.34, P = 0.037), and with insoluble fiber from the whole diet during 
the rye (r = 0.39, P = 0.013) and wheat (r = 0.32, P = 0.047) bread periods. The 
plasma AR 17:0/21:0 ratio differed after the rye (0.84 +/- 0.04) and wheat (0.53 
+/- 0.08) bread diet periods (P < 0.001). These data strongly suggest that 
plasma ARs could be used as specific biomarkers for whole-grain rye intake, and 
their homologue pattern could be used as an indicator of the bread type 
consumed.

    Lepr Rev. 1996 Sep;67(3):230-1.

This paper presents epidemiological data on silent nerve function impairment in 
leprosy based on a retrospective study of 536 patients registered at Green 
Pastures Hospital, Pokhara, West Nepal. Because of the multiple possible 
aetiologies it is proposed that the clinical phenomenon should be named 'Silent 
Neuropathy' (SN). We defined this as sensory or motor impairment without skin 
signs of reversal reaction or erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL), without evident 
nerve tenderness and without spontaneous complaints of nerve pain (burning or 
shooting pain), paraesthesia or numbness. The functioning of the main peripheral 
nerve trunks known to be affected in leprosy was assessed using a nylon filament 
to test touch thresholds and a manual voluntary muscle test to quantify muscle 
strength. Almost 7% of new patients had SN at first examination. The incidence 
rate of SN among the 336 new patients who were available for follow-up was 4.1 
per 100 person years at risk. In total, 75% of all SN episodes diagnosed after 
the start of chemotherapy occurred during the first year of treatment. During 
steroid treatment the sensory and motor function in nerves affected by SN 
improved significantly (p = 0.012, Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed ranks test) 
over a period of 3 months. The patients with more extensive clinical disease 
(3/9 or more body areas involved, more than 3 enlarged nerves or a positive skin 
smear) were found to be at increased risk of developing SN. We discuss 4 
different possible aetiologies of SN: 1, Schwann cell pathology; 2, nerve 
fibrosis; 3, cell-mediated immune reaction; and 4, intra-neural ENL. Some 
epidemiological evidence is presented that suggests that SN cannot be equated 
with a 'reversal reaction expressing itself in the nerves'. It is recommended 
that all patients should have a nerve function assessment at every visit to the 
clinic at least during their first year of treatment. Regular nerve function 
assessment is essential to detect SN at an early stage and to prevent permanent 
impairment of nerve function.

Acute leukemias of different lineages have similar MLL gene fusions encoding 
related chimeric proteins resulting from chromosomal translocation.

The MLL gene, on human chromosome 11q23, undergoes chromosomal translocation in 
acute leukemias, resulting in gene fusion with AF4 (chromosome 4) and ENL 
(chromosome 19). We report here translocation of MLL with nine different 
chromosomes and two paracentric chromosome 11 deletions in early B cell, B- or 
T-cell lineage, or nonlymphocytic acute leukemias. The mRNA translocation 
junction from 22 t(4;11) patients, including six adult leukemias, and nine 
t(11;19) tumors reveals a remarkable conservation of breakpoints within MLL, 
AF4, or ENL genes, irrespective of tumor phenotype. Typically, the breakpoints 
are upstream of the zinc-finger region of MLL, and deletion of this region can 
accompany translocation, supporting the der(11) chromosome as the important 
component in leukemogenesis. Partial sequence of a fusion between MLL and the 
AFX1 gene from chromosome X shows the latter to be rich in Ser/Pro codons, like 
the ENL mRNA. These data suggest that the heterogeneous 11q23 abnormalities 
might cause attachment of Ser/Pro-rich segments to the NH2 terminus of MLL, 
lacking the zinc-finger region, and that translocations occur in early 
hematopoietic cells, before commitment to distinct lineages.

INTRODUCTION: Treatment for erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL), an immunological 
complication of leprosy, is diverse. We undertook a systematic review as it was 
not clear which treatments were most beneficial.
METHODS: We did a systematic search to identify randomised controlled trials 
(RCTs) comparing treatment with placebo, no treatment or another therapy. Two 
authors assessed quality and checked data.
RESULTS: We included 13 studies involving 445 participants. These trials 
assessed: betamethasone, thalidomide, pentoxifylline, clofazimine, indomethacin 
and levamisole. The quality of the trials was generally poor and no results 
could be pooled due to the treatments being so heterogeneous. Treatment with 
thalidomide showed a significant benefit compared to aspirin (RR 2.43; 95% CI 
1.28 to 4.59). Clofazimine treatment was superior to prednisolone (more 
treatment successes; RR 3.67; 95% CI 136 to 9.91) and thalidomide (fewer 
recurrences; RR 0.08; 95% CI 0.01, 0-56). Minor adverse events were 
significantly lower in participants on a low dose thalidomide regimen compared 
to a high dose thalidomide regimen (RR 0.46; 95% CI 0.23 to 0.93). Significantly 
more minor adverse events were reported in participants taking clofazimine 
compared with prednisolone (RR 1.92; 95% CI 1.10 to 3.35). None of the studies 
assessed quality of life or economic outcomes.
CONCLUSION: There is some evidence of benefit for thalidomide and clofazimine, 
but generally we did not find clear benefits for interventions in the management 
of ENL. This does not mean they do not work because the studies were small and 
poorly reported. Larger studies using clear definitions and internationally 
recognised scales are urgently required.

Research, Chandigarh, India. sundogra@hotmail.com

BACKGROUND: Rare variants of leprosy pose a diagnostic challenge even to astute 
clinicians and histoid leprosy is one such form of disease with unique clinical 
and histopathological features. There are very few large series on this entity, 
mainly reported from India.
OBJECTIVES: To study the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 
patients with histoid leprosy.
METHODS: We undertook this retrospective study including patients registered 
with the leprosy clinic of our tertiary care referral centre from January 1991 
to December 2006. Data regarding demographic details, clinical features, 
treatment, complications and course following treatment were extracted from the 
records of the leprosy clinic.
RESULTS: The incidence of histoid leprosy among the registered patients of our 
clinic was 1.8% (40 of 2150). There was a significant male preponderance with a 
male/female ratio of 5.7 : 1. The anatomical areas of involvement were 
thighs/buttocks (67.5%), arms (62.5%), back (52.5%), face (47.5%), forearms 
(47.5%) and legs (35%) in descending order of frequency. This variety of leprosy 
was found most commonly in patients with a primary diagnosis of lepromatous 
leprosy (40%). De novo histoid lesions, i.e. lesions of histoid leprosy 
developing without evidence of lesions of other types of leprosy in the 
Ridley-Jopling classification, appeared in 12.5% of patients only. Only three 
patients had received antileprosy treatment before presentation. Episodes of 
erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) had occurred in 40% of patients, although only 
one patient manifested ENL after the diagnosis of histoid leprosy. The disease 
responded satisfactorily to the respective World Health Organization multidrug 
therapy regimens in all except in one patient who relapsed with borderline 
lepromatous leprosy.
CONCLUSIONS: As the bacillary load is very high in these patients, they can form 
a potential reservoir of the infection in the community especially in the 
postleprosy elimination era. Contrary to the earlier belief in the dapsone era, 
most of our patients manifested disease without any history of inadequate or 
incomplete antileprosy therapy.

Many molecules regulate synaptogenesis, but intracellular signaling pathways 
required for their functions are poorly understood. Afadin is a Rap-regulated, 
actin-binding protein that promotes cadherin complex assembly as well as binding 
many other cell adhesion molecules and receptors. To examine its role in 
mediating synaptogenesis, we deleted afadin (mllt1), using a conditional allele, 
in postmitotic hippocampal neurons. Consistent with its role in promoting 
cadherin recruitment, afadin deletion resulted in 70% fewer and less intense 
N-cadherin puncta with similar reductions of β-catenin and αN-catenin puncta 
densities and 35% reduction in EphB2 puncta density. Its absence also resulted 
in 40% decreases in spine and excitatory synapse densities in the stratum 
radiatum of CA1, as determined by morphology, apposition of presynaptic and 
postsynaptic markers, and synaptic transmission. The remaining synapses appeared 
to function normally. Thus, afadin is a key intracellular signaling molecule for 
cadherin recruitment and is necessary for spine and synapse formation in vivo.

Twenty-five patients with type 1 (lepra) and type 2 (E.N.L.) leprosy reactions 
were studied for lymphocyte adenosine deaminase activity (L-ADA), during and 
after treatment of the reactions, using a standard technique, in order to 
establish its pattern and if possible, its value in assessing the course of 
reactions. The results were compared with those from 30 control subjects, 
comprising 10 normal healthy adults, 10 patients with borderline tuberculoid 
(BT) leprosy, four patients with borderline lepromatous (BL) leprosy and six 
patients with lepromatous (LL) leprosy. The level of L-ADA in the leprosy 
controls was higher than that of normal healthy subjects. The L-ADA values in 
patients with different types of reactions were about 10-fold higher than those 
obtained from leprosy controls, emphasizing a possible role in assessing 
reactions in leprosy. However, there was no significant variation in L-ADA 
levels, either between the various leprosy controls or reaction groups, before 
and after treatment.

YEATS (YAF9, ENL, AF9, TAF14, SAS5) family proteins recognize acylated histones 
and in turn regulate chromatin structure, gene transcription, and stress 
signaling. The chromosomal translocations of ENL and mixed lineage leukemia are 
considered oncogenic drivers in acute myeloid leukemia and acute lymphoid 
leukemia. However, known ENL YEATS domain inhibitors have failed to suppress the 
proliferation of 60 tested cancer cell lines. Herein, we identified four hits 
from the NMR fragment-based screening against the AF9 YEATS domain. Ten 
inhibitors of new chemotypes were then designed and synthesized guided by two 
complex structures and affinity assays. The complex structures revealed that 
these inhibitors formed an extra hydrogen bond to AF9, with respect to known ENL 
inhibitors. Furthermore, these inhibitors demonstrated antiproliferation 
activities in AF9-sensitive HGC-27 cells, which recapitulated the phenotype of 
the CRISPR studies against AF9. Our work will provide the basis for further 
structured-based optimization and reignite the campaign for potent AF9 YEATS 
inhibitors as a precise treatment for AF9-sensitive cancers.

Studies of developmental pathways of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) have 
defined lineage relationships throughout the blood system. This is relevant to 
acute myeloid leukemia (AML), where aggressiveness and therapeutic 
responsiveness can be influenced by the initial stage of transformation. To 
address this, we generated a mouse model in which the mixed-lineage 
leukemia/eleven-nineteen-leukemia (MLL-ENL) transcription factor can be 
conditionally activated in any cell type. We show that AML can originate from 
multiple hematopoietic progenitor subsets with granulocytic and monocytic 
potential, and that the normal developmental position of leukemia-initiating 
cells influences leukemic development. However, disease failed to arise from 
HSCs. Although it maintained or upregulated the expression of target genes 
associated with leukemic development, MLL-ENL dysregulated the proliferative and 
repopulating capacity of HSCs. Therefore, the permissiveness for development of 
AML may be associated with a narrower window of differentiation than was 
previously appreciated, and hijacking the self-renewal capacity of HSCs by a 
potent oncogene is insufficient for leukemic development.

College, New Delhi, India.

INTRODUCTION: Histoid Hansen is rare but a well-defined entity with specific 
clinical, histopathological, and bacteriological features. The incidence has 
been reported to vary from 1-2% amongst total leprosy patients.
METHODOLOGY: We performed a retrospective analysis of the records of patients 
identified as histoid Hansen on the basis of clinico-histopathological criteria, 
who attended the Hansen clinic from 2000-2009.
RESULTS: A total of 962 leprosy patients attended the Hansen clinic from 
2000-2009, and of these, 11 (1.14%) were diagnosed as histoid Hansen. The 
youngest patient on record was 14 years of age. Nearly 70% of the patients were 
untreated and the rest were on multidrug therapy (MDT) before development of 
histoid lesions. Three patients showed Erythema nodusum leposum (ENL) reaction.
CONCLUSION: India has achieved elimination of leprosy, but new cases of histoid 
are still recorded with the same incidence rate. Reactions are not uncommon in 
such forms, and may be a transition phase to manifest lepromatous leprosy. A 
thorough knowledge and early detection is needed for this uncommon variant of 
leprosy which can pose a threat to our elimination drive.

Epilepsy remains an unmet medical need affecting more than 50 million people 
worldwide with about 125,000 mortality annually and more prevalent in low- and 
middle-income countries. Nymphaea lotus (also known as water lilly) is an 
aquatic plant used traditionally to treat convulsive episodes in Southwestern 
Nigeria. This study was undertaken to evaluate anticonvulsant activity of 
aqueous Nymphaea lotus extract (ANL) and ethanol Nymphaea lotus extract (ENL) on 
chemical-induced seizures in mice as well as possible mechanisms of action. 
Vehicle (10 mL/kg, p.o.), ANL (50-200 mg/kg, p.o.), ENL (50-200 mg/kg) or 
diazepam (5 mg/kg, p.o.) was administered 1 h prior to chemo-convulsant 
(picrotoxin (PCT), pentylenetetrazol (PTZ), strychnine or N-methyl-D-aspartate 
(NMDA)) administration. Most effective doses of the extracts were administered 
to mice after the establishment of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) induced by 
kainic acid. Thereafter, memory assessment in Y-maze, depressive-like behaviour 
in tail suspension test (TST) and anxiety model in elevated plus maze test 
(EPM). The prefrontal cortex and hippocampus were assayed for oxidative stress 
parameters. The pretreatment of mice with ANL or ENL significantly prolonged 
onset of seizures and reduced the duration of picrotoxin-, pentylenetetrazol-, 
and strychnine-induced seizures or NMDA-induced turning behaviour. Kainic acid 
induced spontaneous recurrent seizures and oxidative stress were ameliorated by 
N. lotus extracts. Moreover, N. lotus-induced anticonvulsant action was reversed 
by the pretreatment of mice with flumazenil (benzodiazepine receptor antagonist) 
or L-arginine (nitric oxide precursor). In addition, kainic acid induced 
neurodegeneration was reduced by N. lotus extract. Findings from this study 
showed anticonvulsant activity of Nymphaea lotus in neurotoxins-induced seizures 
through enhancement of inhibitory GABAergic/ antioxidant signalling and 
inhibition of glutamatergic neurotransmission.

MLL-AF9 and MLL-ENL alter the dynamic association of transcriptional regulators 
with genes critical for leukemia.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to better understand how mixed lineage 
leukemia (MLL) fusion proteins deregulate the expression of genes critical for 
leukemia.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The transforming domain of one of the most common MLL 
fusion partners, AF9, was immunopurified after expression in myeloblastic M1 
cells, and associating proteins were identified by mass spectrometric analysis. 
Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction 
was used to determine how binding of associating proteins compare across Hoxa9 
and Meis1 in cell lines with and without MLL fusion proteins and how binding is 
altered during gene down-regulation and differentiation.
RESULTS: Consistent with earlier purifications of ENL and AF4 from 293 cells, 
the 90 amino acid C-terminal domain of AF9 associates with many other MLL 
translocation partners including Enl, Af4, Laf4, Af5q31, Ell, and Af10. This 
complex, termed elongation assisting proteins (EAPs), also contains the RNA 
polymerase II C-terminal domain kinase Cdk9/Cyclin T1/T2 (pTEFb) and the histone 
H3 lysine 79 methyltransferase Dot1L. Myeloid cells transformed by MLL fusions 
show higher levels and a broader distribution of EAP components at genes 
critical for leukemia. Inhibition of EAP components pTEFb and Dot1l show that 
both contribute significantly to activation of Hoxa9 and Meis1 expression. EAP 
is dynamically associated with the Hoxa9 and Meis1 loci in hematopoietic cells 
and rapidly dissociates during induction of differentiation. In the presence of 
MLL fusion proteins, its dissociation is prevented.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that MLL fusion proteins deregulate genes 
critical for leukemia by excessive recruitment and impaired dissociation of EAP 
from target loci.

YEATS domain proteins: a diverse family with many links to chromatin 
modification and transcription.

Chromatin modifications play crucial roles in various biological processes. An 
increasing number of conserved protein domains, often found in multisubunit 
protein complexes, are involved in establishing and recognizing different 
chromatin modifications. The YEATS domain is one of these domains, and its role 
in chromatin modifications and transcription is just beginning to be 
appreciated. The YEATS domain family of proteins, conserved from yeast to human, 
contains over 100 members in more than 70 eukaryotic species. Yaf9, Taf14, and 
Sas5 are the only YEATS domain proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Human YEATS 
domain family members, such as GAS41, ENL, and AF9, have a strong link to 
cancer. GAS41 is amplified in glioblastomas and astrocytomas; ENL and AF9 are 
among the most frequent translocation partners of the mixed lineage leukemia 
(MLL) gene. This review will focus on the best characterized YEATS proteins, 
discuss their diverse roles, and reflect potential functions of the YEATS 
domain.

Recently new mammalian lignan precursors were identified but no analysis methods 
are available for assay of those compounds in human urine. Previously published 
methods were developed for GC-MS about only two plant lignans were included. 
Consequently, a method for HPLC equipped with a coulometric electrode array 
detector was developed to measure plant and mammalian lignans in human urine. 
The plant lignans, secoisolariciresinol (Seco), matairesinol (Mat), 
lariciresinol (Lar), pinoresinol (Pin), syringaresinol (Syr) and 
isolariciresinol (IsoL) were included into the new method together with two 
mammalian lignans, enterolactone (Enl) and enterodiol (End). Validation of the 
method demonstrated that it could be applied to normal urine containing low 
amounts of plant lignans and moderate amounts of mammalian lignans, but the 
method was also applicable for samples from study subjects in supplementation 
studies, i.e. sample with very high concentrations of mammalian lignans. The 
method was found to be a useful tool for studies on plant lignan intake and the 
activity of micro flora in the metabolism of plant lignans.

Phytoestrogens can alleviate some pathological processes related to nonalcoholic 
fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, there are limited and contradictory 
studies on the relationships between phytoestrogens (especially single 
phytoestrogen) and NAFLD. The purpose of this study was to explore the 
relationships between urinary phytoestrogen concentrations and NAFLD in American 
adults. This cross-sectional study used the data of the National Health and 
Nutrition Examination Survey from 1999 to 2010, and 2294 adults were finally 
enrolled in this study. The concentrations of phytoestrogens were measured in 
urine samples, and urinary phytoestrogens were divided into tertiles according 
to the concentration distributions. The diagnosis of NAFLD was determined by the 
United States fatty liver index. The main analysis used a multivariate logistic 
regression model. The fully adjusted models included gender, age, race, 
education, marriage, poverty, body mass index, waist circumference, smoking, 
diabetes, hypertension, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 
triglycerides, and other five phytoestrogens. In the fully adjusted model, the 
urinary enterolactone (ENL) concentration was negatively correlated with NAFLD 
(OR of Tertile 3 : 0.48, 95% CI 0.25-0.94). When stratified by age and gender, 
the urinary ENL concentration was negatively correlated with NAFLD in males aged 
40-59 years (OR of Tertile 3 : 0.08, 95% CI 0.01-0.82), while the urinary equol 
concentration was positively correlated with NAFLD in such population (OR of 
Tertile 3 : 4.27, 95% CI 1.02-17.85). In addition, a negative correlation 
between enterodiol (END) concentration and NAFLD was observed in males aged 60 
years or over (OR of Tertile 2 : 0.18, 95% CI 0.05-0.69). Collectively, in 
middle-aged males, urinary ENL may be associated with a lower risk of NAFLD, 
while urinary equol may be related to a higher risk. In addition, urinary END 
has a possible relationship with a reduced risk of NAFLD in elder males. 
Definitely, clinical randomized controlled trials are needed to further verify 
the conclusions.

Between 1980 and 1994, 67 new or relapsing leprosy patients were treated by 
daily administered multidrug regimens. Tuberculoid patients (23 TT/BT) received 
either bitherapy [rifampin + dapsone or clofazimine (RMP + DDS or CLO)] or 
tritherapy [RMP + DDS and/or CLO and/or ethionamide (ETH)] until clinical cure. 
Lepromatous patients (44 BB/BL/LL) received tritherapy (RMP + DDS and/or CLO 
and/or ETH) at least until bacteriological negativity. Of the 23 tuberculoid 
patients only one patient (5%) was cured at 6 months and about 70% needed 
between 6 and 24 months of treatment to obtain clinical cure (mean 19.5 months). 
In the 44 lepromatous patients, the achievement of bacteriological negativity 
was significantly linked to the initial bacterial index (BI), and it occurred 
after 2 to 7 years (mean 66.5 months) of multidrug therapy (MDT). The average BI 
decrease per year was 1.1+ during the first year, 0.9+ the second year, and then 
< 0.5+ per year. Reactional states significantly (p < 0.01) influenced the BI 
course: reversal reactions (RR) accelerated while erythema nodosum leprosum 
(ENL) delayed the BI decrease. Three of the 23 (13%) tuberculoid and 19 of the 
44 (43%) lepromatous patients (p < 0.02) exhibited a RR and 18 of 44 (41%) 
lepromatous patients had ENL during MDT. A late RR (LRR) was observed in 1 (5%) 
and 6 (17%) of our tuberculoid and lepromatous patients, respectively, and 3 
(8%) of our lepromatous patients suffered post-MDT ENL. No confirmed relapse has 
been observed within a follow-up period of 6 months to 7 years and 3 months [59 
person-years at risk (PYR)] for TT/BT patients and of 4 months to 5 years and 10 
months (100 PYR) for BB/BL/LL patients. When compared to the recommended 
WHO/MDT, it appears that daily MDT does not increase the clinical or the 
bacteriological cure rates either at 6 months in paucibacillary tuberculoid 
patients or at 2d years in multibacillary lepromatous patients. Moreover, as 
does the WHO/MDT, our regimens show a high frequency of reactional states both 
during and after treatment. This fact constitutes the main new problem of the 
actual treatment of leprosy.

Occurrence of reactions, their diagnosis and management in leprosy patients 
treated with multidrug therapy; experience in the leprosy control program of the 
All Africa Leprosy and Rehabilitation Training Center (ALERT) in Ethiopia.

This paper reports on reactions in leprosy patients who were treated with 
multidrug therapy (MDT) in the leprosy control program of the All Africa Leprosy 
and Rehabilitation Training Center (ALERT) in Ethiopia. Only those reactions 
which occurred in patients who had not been treated with dapsone before MDT and 
which required treatment with prednisolone were included. Until the end of the 
second year of MDT a reversal reaction had been diagnosed in 43.6% of 266 
borderline lepromatous (BL) patients and in 19.2% of 109 lepromatous leprosy 
(LL) patients, and an erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) reaction in 2.7% and 11.1% 
of the patients, respectively. The reversal reactions were observed in 4.9% of 
the BL patients and in 0% of the LL patients at the time of diagnosis of 
leprosy, in 26.3% and 12.8% of the patients during the first year of MDT, and in 
12.4% and 6.4% during the second year of MDT. ENL reactions were seen in 0.8% of 
BL patients at diagnosis, 1.1% in the first year and 0.8% in the second year and 
2.8% at diagnosis, 5.5% in the first year, and 2.8% in the second year for LL 
patients. During a 3 1/2-year period, a total of 405 reactions were diagnosed 
among multibacillary (MB) patients on MDT; 365 of these reactions (90.1%) were 
reversal reactions and only 40 (9.9%) were ENL reactions. The point in time of 
the reversal reactions showed that the risk of reversal reaction is highest 
during the first year of MDT. Thereafter there is a gradual decline, although 
reactions were still observed during the fifth year of MDT. A reversal reaction 
was diagnosed in 21.0% of 438 BT patients; in 3.4% of the patients the reaction 
was present at the time of diagnosis of leprosy; in 10.3% it occurred during 
MDT, and in 7.3% during the first year after release from MDT. During a period 
of 3 1/2 years a total of 183 reversal reactions were diagnosed among BT 
patients. The point in time showed a declining trend in the risk of reversal 
reaction after starting MDT. The risk is highest during MDT, followed by the 
first 6 months after stopping MDT. However, reactions, although few, still 
occurred during the fourth year after stopping MDT. The analysis of the results 
of prednisolone treatment in 161 patients who were treated for nerve function 
loss in the field showed that 142 patients (88.2%) regained complete or partial 
recovery of the nerve function(s), while no improvement was observed in 19 
patients (11.8%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

Modifications of histone proteins have essential roles in normal development and 
human disease. Recognition of modified histones by 'reader' proteins is a key 
mechanism that mediates the function of histone modifications, but how the 
dysregulation of these readers might contribute to disease remains poorly 
understood. We previously identified the ENL protein as a reader of histone 
acetylation via its YEATS domain, linking it to the expression of cancer-driving 
genes in acute leukaemia1. Recurrent hotspot mutations have been found in the 
ENL YEATS domain in Wilms tumour2,3, the most common type of paediatric kidney 
cancer. Here we show, using human and mouse cells, that these mutations impair 
cell-fate regulation by conferring gain-of-function in chromatin recruitment and 
transcriptional control. ENL mutants induce gene-expression changes that favour 
a premalignant cell fate, and, in an assay for nephrogenesis using murine cells, 
result in undifferentiated structures resembling those observed in human Wilms 
tumour. Mechanistically, although bound to largely similar genomic loci as the 
wild-type protein, ENL mutants exhibit increased occupancy at a subset of 
targets, leading to a marked increase in the recruitment and activity of 
transcription elongation machinery that enforces active transcription from 
target loci. Furthermore, ectopically expressed ENL mutants exhibit greater 
self-association and form discrete and dynamic nuclear puncta that are 
characteristic of biomolecular hubs consisting of local high concentrations of 
regulatory factors. Such mutation-driven ENL self-association is functionally 
linked to enhanced chromatin occupancy and gene activation. Collectively, our 
findings show that hotspot mutations in a chromatin-reader domain drive 
self-reinforced recruitment, derailing normal cell-fate control during 
development and leading to an oncogenic outcome.

There are very few autopsy studies available on systemic distribution of 
clofazimine, a drug with anti-mycobacterial activity, used in multidrug therapy 
(MDT) regimen of leprosy and in erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL). An autopsy 
study was done on a 45 year old female of lepromatous leprosy (LL) on MDT and 
long term high dosage of clofazimine. Patient succumbed to intractable abdominal 
pain, diarrhoea, hypokalemia following clofazimine treatment. Autopsy study 
revealed yellowish brown discoloration of skin, viscera and body fluids. 
Chemical extraction of the drug revealed the highest concentration of the drug 
in jejunum (1.5mg/gm),followed by spleen (1.2mg/gm), pancreas (0.4mg/gm), 
adrenal (0.25mg/gm), liver (0.21mg/gm), and less than 0.2mg/gm in lung, fat, 
large intestine and stomach. It can be inferred from the present study that the 
drug is absorbed from the jejunum and gets deposited in fat, 
reticulo-endothelial cells (R-E cells) and hepatocytes. The drug is best 
demonstrated in cryostat sections and is lost partly during tissue processing 
and staining. The drug toxicity can be fatal as seen in the present case.

Gynaecomastia in leprosy in three districts of Tamil Nadu.

Roy RG, Kar HK, Murthy NN.

The prevalence of Gynaecomastia (GM), a well known complication of leprosy in 
adult male patients was studied in 790 cases of whom 641 were the inmates of 
five leprosy hospitals and the remaining 149 mostly from the clinics of field 
area attached to the Central Leprosy Teaching and Research Institute, 
Chengalpattu during 1982-83. The overall prevalence rate was found to be 19.24%. 
Among the hospitalised patients, it was 22.15% against 6.71% among the patients 
attending the clinics in the field area. The youngest and the oldest patient in 
this study was 16 years and 83 years respectively. The highest rate of 32.89% 
was in the 36-45 age group. Only 152 GM cases were detected; the rates in the 
lepromatous, borderline lepromatous, borderline tuberculoid were 29.21%, 9.64% 
and 3.68% respectively. Those who gave a history of frequent ENL reactions had a 
higher rate of GM i.e. 34.55 as against 21.52 without or with very infrequent 
ENL reaction. Early treatment had a remarkable effect in the reduction of GM. 
Only 14% developed GM when the treatment was started within 2 years after the 
onset of leprosy as against 46.9% when the same was started after 16 years. In 
the latter group, the longer duration of the disease could also play a 
contributory role. Sterility rate was more than double in those with GM i.e. 
34.14% against 14% without it.

Consumption of diet rich in lignans may decrease the risk of some chronic 
hormonal conditions such as benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). This study 
investigated whether a lignan-rich extract from flaxseed hulls, LinumLife EXTRA 
(LLE), could prevent BPH using the testosterone propionate (TP)-induced BPH rat 
model. Male Wistar-Unilever rats were randomly divided into four groups of 12 
rats each: a negative control group fed with control diet and receiving daily 
subcutaneous injections of corn oil without TP, and three groups fed with 
control diet (positive control), diet containing 0.5% LLE (LLE 0.5) or 1.0% LLE 
(LLE 1.0) and receiving daily subcutaneous injections of TP in corn oil. 
Treatments with diets started 2 weeks before the induction of BPH and were 
carried out for 5 consecutive weeks. The influence of TP and LLE on body weight 
(BW), food and water consumptions, and enterolactone (ENL) levels in serum and 
urine of rats was examined at the end of the 5-week treatment period. TP 
significantly diminished the mean body weight gain (MBWG) of positive control 
rats and their food and water consumptions while LLE reduced significantly this 
MBWG reduction in a dose-dependent manner. The lignan-rich extract significantly 
inhibited TP-induced prostate size ratio (prostate weight/rat BW) increase in 
comparison with positive controls (P<.001). This effect was dose dependent. 
Higher serum and urine levels of ENL correlated well with the dose of extract 
provided to rats. It was concluded that the lignan-rich flaxseed hull extract 
prevented the TP-induced BPH indicating it might be beneficial in the prevention 
of BPH.

BACKGROUND: The ILEP Nerve Function Impairment in Reaction (INFIR) is a cohort 
study designed to identify predictors of reactions and nerve function impairment 
in leprosy. The aim was to study correlations between clinical and histological 
diagnosis of reactions.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Three hundred and three newly diagnosed patients 
with World Health Organization multibacillary (MB) leprosy from two centres in 
India were enrolled in the study. Skin biopsies taken at enrolment were assessed 
using a standardised proforma to collect data on the histological diagnosis of 
leprosy, leprosy reactions and the certainty level of the diagnosis. The 
pathologist diagnosed definite or probable Type 1 Reactions (T1R) in 113 of 265 
biopsies from patients at risk of developing reactions whereas clinicians 
diagnosed skin only reactions in 39 patients and 19 with skin and nerve 
involvement. Patients with Borderline Tuberculoid (BT) leprosy had a clinical 
diagnosis rate of reactions of 43% and a histological diagnosis rate of 61%; for 
patients with Borderline Lepromatous (BL) leprosy the clinical and histological 
diagnosis rates were 53.7% and 46.2% respectively. The sensitivity and 
specificity of clinical diagnosis for T1R was 53.1% and 61.9% for BT patients 
and 61.1% and 71.0% for BL patients. Erythema Nodosum Leprosum (ENL) was 
diagnosed clinically in two patients but histologically in 13 patients. The 
Ridley-Jopling classification of patients (n = 303) was 42.8% BT, 27.4% BL, 9.4% 
Lepromatous Leprosy (LL), 13.0% Indeterminate and 7.4% with non-specific 
inflammation. This data shows that MB classification is very heterogeneous and 
encompasses patients with no detectable bacteria and high immunological activity 
through to patients with high bacterial loads.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Leprosy reactions may be under-diagnosed by clinicians 
and increasing biopsy rates would help in the diagnosis of reactions. Future 
studies should look at sub-clinical T1R and ENL and whether they have impact on 
clinical outcomes.

Presenting evidence and summary measures to best inform societal decisions when 
comparing multiple strategies.

Multiple strategy comparisons in health technology assessment (HTA) are becoming 
increasingly important, with multiple alternative therapeutic actions, 
combinations of therapies and diagnostic and genetic testing alternatives. 
Comparison under uncertainty of incremental cost, effects and cost effectiveness 
across more than two strategies is conceptually and practically very different 
from that for two strategies, where all evidence can be summarized in a single 
bivariate distribution on the incremental cost-effectiveness plane. Alternative 
methods for comparing multiple strategies in HTA have been developed in (i) 
presenting cost and effects on the cost-disutility plane and (ii) summarizing 
evidence with multiple strategy cost-effectiveness acceptability (CEA) and 
expected net loss (ENL) curves and frontiers. However, critical questions remain 
for the analyst and decision maker of how these techniques can be best employed 
across multiple strategies to (i) inform clinical and cost inference in 
presenting evidence, and (ii) summarize evidence of cost effectiveness to inform 
societal reimbursement decisions where preferences may be risk neutral or 
somewhat risk averse under the Arrow-Lind theorem. We critically consider how 
evidence across multiple strategies can be best presented and summarized to 
inform inference and societal reimbursement decisions, given currently available 
methods. In the process, we make a number of important original findings. First, 
in presenting evidence for multiple strategies, the joint distribution of costs 
and effects on the cost-disutility plane with associated flexible comparators 
varying across replicates for cost and effect axes ensure full cost and effect 
inference. Such inference is usually confounded on the cost-effectiveness plane 
with comparison relative to a fixed origin and axes. Second, in summarizing 
evidence for risk-neutral societal decision making, ENL curves and frontiers are 
shown to have advantages over the CEA frontier in directly presenting 
differences in expected net benefit (ENB). The CEA frontier, while identifying 
strategies that maximize ENB, only presents their probability of maximizing net 
benefit (NB) and, hence, fails to explain why strategies maximize ENB at any 
given threshold value. Third, in summarizing evidence for somewhat risk-averse 
societal decision making, trade-offs between the strategy maximizing ENB and 
other potentially optimal strategies with higher probability of maximizing NB 
should be presented over discrete threshold values where they arise. However, 
the probabilities informing these trade-offs and associated discrete threshold 
value regions should be derived from bilateral CEA curves to prevent confounding 
by other strategies inherent in multiple strategy CEA curves. Based on these 
findings, a series of recommendations are made for best presenting and 
summarizing cost-effectiveness evidence for reimbursement decisions when 
comparing multiple strategies, which are contrasted with advice for comparing 
two strategies. Implications for joint research and reimbursement decisions are 
also discussed.

During the last 20 years, the global leprosy situation has strikingly changed 
with a decrease of cases from 12 millions estimated cases in 1982 to 600,000 
registered cases in the year 2000. However, during the past 15 years, about 
700,000 new cases are still detected annually. The systematic use of multidrug 
therapy (MDT), as recommended by a WHO Study Group in 1982, has proven its 
efficacy as assessed by the low reported relapse rate (less than 1% per year). 
The initial PCT schedule has been modified several times, but this PCT remains 
the recommended chemotherapy for the great majority of patients. New potent 
antibacillary drugs (ofloxacin, minocycline, clarithromycine) have been 
discovered; however, their current use is limited and should remain limited 
until under way trials could confirm their efficacy. With the use of PCT, the 
frequency of immunologically mediated reactional states have changed. The 
occurrence of reversal reaction, (type 1 reaction) has significantly increased 
while that of erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL, type 2) appeared less common. 
Because of the high risk of neurological permanent damage, reversal reaction 
needs to be diagnosed and treated as soon as possible. Here in, the current 
antibacillary and antireactionnal treatments are being reviewed.

Thalidomide is an immunomodulatory agent that is approved for use in patients 
with cutaneous manifestations of erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL). It is 
currently under clinical investigation in a wide range of malignancies and 
immunologic-based disorders. Structural analogs of thalidomide have been 
synthesized in order to explore potential molecular targets of thalidomide, as 
well as to identify new therapeutics. Members of one class of analogs, termed 
immunomodulatory drugs (IMiD), are 100 to 1,000 times more potent than 
thalidomide in regulating cytokine production by peripheral blood mononuclear 
cells and providing a costimulatory signal for T-cell proliferation. Notably, 
the nature of the stimulus and the cell type are important determinants as to 
whether the IMiDs or thalidomide cause an inhibitory or stimulatory effect. The 
IMiD CDC-501 has been selected for clinical development; it had been safely 
administered to volunteers in single doses of 50 to 400 mg and in multiple doses 
of 100 mg for 7 days. Phase I/II studies of CDC-501 in multiple myeloma are in 
progress.

Combined effect of cytostatic drugs and E-N-L-trimethyl lysine in healthy and 
transplantable tumor bearing mice.

Szende B, Lapis K, Simon K.

E-N-L-trimethyl lysine (TML) decreases the toxicity of Vincristin, 
Cyclophosphamide and Doxorubicin (Adriamycin) when administered simultaneously 
to healthy mice. Simultaneous treatment of L1210 ascites leukemia bearing mice 
with 100 mg/kg TML and 2, 2.5, 3.2, 3.5, 4 mg/kg Vincristin or 10-15; 20 mg/kg 
Doxorubicin increases significantly the survival of the animals when compared 
with untreated and Vincristin or Doxorubicin treated mice. Repeated impulse 
treatment of S-180 subcutaneous sarcoma with 100 mg/kg TML and 50-100 mg/kg 
Cyclophosphamide results in a significantly higher surviving time and surviving 
rate than Cyclophosphamide treatment alone.

COVID-19, leprosy, and neutrophils.

Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), a disease caused by the betacoronavirus 
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has only recently 
emerged, while Mycobacterium leprae, the etiological agent of leprosy, has 
endured for more than 2,000 years. As soon as the initial reports of COVID-19 
became public, several entities, including the Brazilian Leprosy Society, warned 
about the possible impact of COVID-19 on leprosy patients. It has been verified 
that COVID-19 carriers can be either asymptomatic or present varying degrees of 
severe respiratory failure in association with cytokine storm and death, among 
other diseases. Severe COVID-19 patients show increased numbers of neutrophils 
and serum neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) markers, in addition to 
alterations in the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR). The absence of 
antiviral drugs and the speed of COVID-19 transmission have had a major impact 
on public health systems worldwide, leading to the almost total collapse of many 
national and local healthcare services. Leprosy, an infectious neurological and 
dermatological illness, is widely considered to be the most frequent cause of 
physical disabilities globally. The chronic clinical course of the disease may 
be interrupted by acute inflammatory episodes, named leprosy reactions. These 
serious immunological complications, characterized by cytokine storms, are 
responsible for amplifying peripheral nerve damage. From 30% to 40% of all 
multibacillary leprosy (MB) patients experience erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL), 
a neutrophilic immune-mediated condition. ENL patients often present these same 
COVID-19-like symptoms, including high levels of serum NET markers, altered NLR, 
and neutrophilia. Moreover, the consequences of a M. leprae-SARS-CoV-2 
coinfection have yet to be fully investigated. The goal of the present viewpoint 
is to describe some of the similarities that may be found between COVID-19 and 
leprosy disease in the context of neutrophilic biology.

INTRODUCTION: Extranodal lymphoma (ENL) in the muscles is a rare manifestation 
of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). The aim of this case report is to describe and 
evaluate the clinical presentation and important radiologic features of ENL 
affecting the musculoskeletal system.
PRESENTATION OF CASE: We present a 52-year-old female with a 3-week history of 
left gluteal pain. Computed tomography (CT) showed a non-uniformly early 
enhancing mass in the left gluteal muscle, the tumor demonstrating central 
necrosis and adjacent bone involvement. Fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron 
emission tomography ((18)F-FDG PET)/CT showed areas of increased (18)F-FDG 
uptake in the left gluteal musculature, pelvic bones, para-aortic and 
mediastinal lymph nodes and both lungs. Histopathological examination showed a 
diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). After 8 cycles of R-CHOP chemotherapy, 
the mass in the left gluteal muscle has completely disappeared
DISCUSSION: Although destructive tumor originating in the gluteal muscle with 
adjacent bone involvement is more common in soft tissue sarcoma, lymphoma should 
be regularly included in the differential diagnosis. While CT is a useful 
modality for assessing soft tissue masses, disruption and injury of the 
surrounding tissues, PET/CT fusion is superior for the detection of unexpected 
extranodal sites of disease, or for exclusion of disease in the presence of 
nonspecific extranodal CT findings.
CONCLUSION: A rapid growth pattern and destructive masses that invade adjacent 
structures on CT are key findings of DLBCL, and (18)F-FDG PET/CT is a useful 
imaging modality to accurately determine the disease stage and disease 
aggressiveness of NHL.

Genistein alone and in combination with the mammalian lignans enterolactone and 
enterodiol induce estrogenic effects on bone and uterus in a postmenopausal 
breast cancer mouse model.

The use of phytoestrogens, such as isoflavones and lignans, for treatment of 
postmenopausal breast cancer is increasing, but their effects on bone and other 
major organs are not clear. While the isoflavone genistein (GEN) has been shown 
to prevent or slow the loss of bone mineral density (BMD), the effect of lignans 
enterodiol (END) and enterolactone (ENL) are unknown. In this study, we 
determined in ovariectomized mice with human MCF-7 breast tumor xenografts the 
effects of the lignans, and GEN, alone and in combination, on bone and uterus. 
Mice with established MCF-7 tumors were fed a basal diet (AIN-93G), divided into 
5 groups, and given daily subcutaneous injections (10 mg/kg body weight) of 
either ENL, END, GEN, a mixture of these compounds (MIX), or vehicle as a 
negative control for 22 weeks. Results showed that GEN acts estrogenically in 
both the uterus and bone by increasing the uterus weight, femur BMD, and femur 
biomechanical strength (yield load), while the lignans do not. However, 
treatment with MIX induced minimal effects on femur biomechanical strength 
parameters but significantly increased uterus weight. A significant positive 
correlation was observed between MCF-7 tumor volume and femur BMD and 
biomechanical strength parameters (femur peak load and yield load) but not with 
uterus weight, suggesting that the uterus may respond differently to 
phytoestrogens compared to MCF-7 tumors and bone. It is concluded that GEN 
induces beneficial effects on bone but has adverse effects on tumors and uterus 
in this model of postmenopausal breast cancer. The lignans do not exert adverse 
effects on any tissue, however, when combined with GEN, they exert an adverse 
effect on the uterus.

Mll fusions generated by Cre-loxP-mediated de novo translocations can induce 
lineage reassignment in tumorigenesis.

Drynan LF(1), Pannell R, Forster A, Chan NM, Cano F, Daser A, Rabbitts TH.

Author information:

Chromosomal translocations are primary events in tumorigenesis. Those involving 
the mixed lineage leukaemia (MLL) gene are found in various guises and it is 
unclear whether MLL fusions can affect haematopoietic differentiation. We have 
used a model in which chromosomal translocations are generated in mice de novo 
by Cre-loxP-mediated recombination (translocator mice) to compare the 
functionally relevant haematopoietic cell contexts for Mll fusions, namely 
pluripotent stem cells, semicommitted progenitors or committed cells. 
Translocations between Mll and Enl or Af9 cause myeloid neoplasias, initiating 
in pluripotent stem cells or multipotent myeloid progenitors. However, while 
Mll-Enl translocations can also cause leukaemia from T-cell progenitors, no 
tumours arose with Mll-Af9 translocations in the T-cell compartment. 
Furthermore, Mll-Enl translocations in T-cell progenitors can cause lineage 
reassignment into myeloid tumours. Therefore, a permissive cellular environment 
is required for oncogenicity of Mll-associated translocations and Mll fusions 
can influence haematopoietic lineage commitment.

Response to treatment by multidrug regimens in the THELEP controlled clinical 
drug trials. Subcommittee on Clinical Trials of the Chemotherapy of Leprosy 
(THELEP) Scientific Working Group of the UNDP/World Bank/WHO Special Programme 
for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases.

[No authors listed]

During the period 1977-1983, clinical trials of five multidrug regimens were 
conducted among 215 patients with previously untreated multibacillary leprosy at 
the Institut Marchoux, Bamako, Mali, and the Central Leprosy Teaching and 
Research Institute, Chingleput, South India. The trials were designed primarily 
to permit measurement of the proportions of persisting Mycobacterium leprae in 
the patients' skin lesions. In addition, the combination of the large number of 
patients studied, the large volume of carefully standardized data, and the 
employment of multidrug regimens provided a unique opportunity to measure the 
clinical response of patients to treatment by these regimens. Persisting M. 
leprae were detected in 7.8% of all specimens; the frequency did not vary with 
centre, regimen, or duration of treatment. The bacterial index (BI) decreased by 
a mean annual rate of 75%, the logarithmic biopsy index by a mean annual rate of 
87%, and the logarithm10 number of acid-fast bacilli per g tissue by a mean 
annual rate of 69%. The rate of decrease of these measures of the numbers of M. 
leprae was related to the 'strength' of the regimen. Although no difference of 
clinical status as a function of regimen was demonstrated, a difference was 
observed between the two centres, probably the result of different clinical 
criteria employed by the responsible physicians. A change of histopathological 
classification in the course of the trials was recorded for 12% of the patients, 
most representing upgrading from LLs to BL, without relation to regimen or 
treatment centre. ENL was less severe for the patients treated by the maximal 
regimen in Chingleput, which included daily clofazimine; as expected, the 
majority of patients treated by this regimen were found to have maximal 
pigmentation. Prednisolone was evidently preferred for treatment of ENL in 
Chingleput, whereas thalidomide was preferred in Bamako. Fourteen cases of 
jaundice were observed, primarily among the patients treated by the maximal 
regimens, that included daily administration of rifampicin for the entire two 
years of the trials. Measurements of weight and blood pressure, and studies of 
the blood and of hepatic and urinary tract function revealed only negligible 
differences among regimens and between centres. In many cases, those differences 
that were observed were associated with ENL.

DOT1L, the only H3K79 methyltransferase in human cells and a homolog of the 
yeast Dot1, normally forms a complex with AF10, AF17, and ENL or AF9, is 
dysregulated in most cases of mixed-lineage leukemia (MLLr), and has been 
believed to regulate transcriptional elongation on the basis of its 
colocalization with RNA polymerase II (Pol II), the sharing of subunits (AF9 and 
ENL) between the DOT1L and super elongation complexes, and the distribution of 
H3K79 methylation on both promoters and transcribed regions of active genes. 
Here we show that DOT1L depletion in erythroleukemic cells reduces its global 
occupancy without affecting the traveling ratio or the elongation rate (assessed 
by 4sUDRB-seq) of Pol II, suggesting that DOT1L does not play a major role in 
elongation in these cells. In contrast, analyses of transcription initiation 
factor binding reveal that DOT1L and ENL depletions each result in reduced TATA 
binding protein (TBP) occupancies on thousands of genes. More importantly, DOT1L 
and ENL depletions concomitantly reduce TBP and Pol II occupancies on a 
significant fraction of direct (DOT1L-bound) target genes, indicating a role for 
the DOT1L complex in transcription initiation. Mechanistically, proteomic and 
biochemical studies suggest that the DOT1L complex may regulate transcriptional 
initiation by facilitating the recruitment or stabilization of transcription 
factor IID, likely in a monoubiquitinated H2B (H2Bub1)-enhanced manner. 
Additional studies show that DOT1L enhances H2Bub1 levels by limiting 
recruitment of the Spt-Ada-Gcn5-acetyltransferase (SAGA) complex. These results 
advance our understanding of roles of the DOT1L complex in transcriptional 
regulation and have important implications for MLLr leukemias.

7-Hydroxymatairesinol (7-HMR) is a plant lignan abundant in various 
concentrations in plant foods. The objective of this study was to test 
HMRLignan™, a purified form of 7-HMR, and the corresponding Picea abies extract 
(total extract P. abies; TEP) as dietary supplements on a background of a 
high-fat diet (HFD)-induced metabolic syndrome in mice and in the 3T3-L1 
adipogenesis model. Mice, 3 weeks old, were fed a HFD for 60 d. Subgroups were 
treated with 3 mg/kg body weight 7-HMR (HMRLignan™) or 10 mg/kg body weight TEP 
by oral administration. 7-HMR and TEP limited the increase in body weight (-11 
and -13 %) and fat mass (-11 and -18 %) in the HFD-fed mice. Epididymal 
adipocytes were 19 and -12 % smaller and the liver was less steatotic (-62 and 
-65 %). Serum lipids decreased in TEP-treated mice (-11 % cholesterol, -23 % LDL 
and -15 % TAG) and sugar metabolism was ameliorated by both lignan preparations, 
as shown by a more than 70 % decrease in insulin secretion and insulin 
resistance. The expression of several metabolic genes was modulated by the HFD 
with an effect that was reversed by lignan. In 3T3-L1 cells, the 7-HMR 
metabolites enterolactone (ENL) and enterodiol (END) showed a 40 % inhibition of 
cell differentiation accompanied by the inhibited expression of the adipogenic 
genes PPARγ, C/EBPα and aP2. Furthermore, END and ENL caused a 10 % reduction in 
TAG uptake in HEPA 1-6 hepatoma cells. In conclusion, 7-HMR and TEP reduce 
metabolic imbalances typical of the metabolic syndrome and obesity in male mice, 
whereas their metabolites inhibit adipogenesis and lipid uptake in vitro.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the occurrence and characteristics of lepra reactions in 
leprosy patients.
METHODS: The retrospective study was conducted at the Marie Adelaide Leprosy 
Centre, Karachi, and comprised data of patients admitted between January 1, 
2013, and December 31, 2015, for the management of lepra reactions. Data was 
noted on a detailed proforma and was analysed using Microsoft Excel and applying 
chi-square test.
RESULTS: Of the 130 cases, 95(73%) were males and 35(27%) were females. Mean age 
at onset of the first episode was 39±14 years. Borderline lepromatous was the 
most common classification 76(58%), with 40(53%) of them having type 1 reaction 
as the first episode and 36(47%) having a type 2 reaction Risk factors 
associated with recurrence were skin lesions, fever, lymphadenopathy and type of 
reaction (p<0.05).
CONCLUSION: Healthcare providers need to be aware of the clinical manifestations 
of lepra reactions in order to diagnose them early.

Cytotoxic T cells play an important role in host defence mechanisms, as well as 
in the immunopathology of leprosy. In this study, we evaluated whether 
Mycobacterium leprae hsp18, hsp65 and Myco. tuberculosis hsp71 could induce 
cytotoxic T cell activity against autologous macrophages pulsed with these hsp. 
Paucibacillary (PB) patients and normal controls generated more effector cells 
than multibacillary (MB) patients with all three hsp tested. There was no 
cross-reactivity between any of the hsp tested. Mycobacterium leprae hsp65 
induced cytotoxic responses only in those MB patients undergoing an erythema 
nodosum leprosum (ENL) episode. Although hsp65 and hsp18 induced similar 
proliferation in MB patients, a high proportion of these patients did not 
generate cytotoxic effector cells in response to hsp65. Hence, those T cells 
reacting to hsp65 may play an important role in the control of Myco. leprae 
infection.

such as fatty acid omega-3, fiber, lignans and flavonoids. The bioactivity of 
lignans and flavonoids depends greatly on bacterial metabolism. Previously, 
lactobacilli and bifidobacteria strains were described to produce enterolignans 
and bioactive flavonoids (herbacetin, quercetin, quercetagetin, kaempferol, 
naringenin and eriodictyol) from flaxseed extracts and/or from 
secoisolariciresinol (SECO) in culture medium. In this work, cow's milk and soy 
beverage were supplemented with flaxseed extracts and fermented with selected 
lactobacilli and bifidobacteria strains. Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus INIA P224, 
Limosilactobacillus mucosae INIA P508 and Lactiplantibacillus plantarum ESI 144 
were capable of producing enterolactone (ENL) in both beverages supplemented 
with flaxseed, in addition to matairesinol and the flavonoids daidzein, 
genistein, glycitein, quercetin, naringenin, kaempferol and eriodictyol. On the 
other hand, Bifidobacterium breve INIA P367, Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum 
INIA P815 and Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum INIA P946 were able to produce 
quercetin, quercetagetin and high concentrations of herbacetin and SECO, in 
addition to pinoresinol, matairesinol, daidzein, genistein, naringenin, 
kaempferol and eriodictyol. The co-incubation of Lacticaseibacillus paracasei 
INIA P74 and Ligilactobacillus salivarius INIA P183 with Lactococcus lactis 
MG1363 harboring the food grade vector pLEB590.gly913, facilitated the 
production of ENL in soy beverage enriched with flaxseed. In this work, it is 
demonstrated how lactobacilli and bifidobacteria strains can improve the 
nutritional properties of flaxseed-enriched beverages, providing metabolites of 
great interest for human health.

Simple measures that can facilitate early recognition of leprosy complications 
are still lacking. We therefore evaluated a lateral flow-based rapid diagnostic 
test and fast enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay measuring anti-LID-NDO antibody 
responses among leprosy cases in Cebu, Philippines. Responses were measured at 
diagnosis, then during and after the provision of standard multidrug therapy. 
Our data indicate that both platforms are highly sensitive tools for the primary 
diagnosis of, in particular, multibacillary leprosy. A gradual, quantifiable 
decline in both magnitude of response and percent positive responders was 
observed during and after treatment. As a group, patients that developed 
erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) had a significantly higher response at diagnosis 
than patients that either developed reversal reactions or did not develop 
reactions. Although higher initial anti-NDO-LID responses were a risk factor for 
ENL, neither platform, however, could reliably predict the time of emergence of 
reactional episodes.

Enlazin, a natural fusion of two classes of canonical cytoskeletal proteins, 
contributes to cytokinesis dynamics.

Octtaviani E(1), Effler JC, Robinson DN.

Author information:

21205, USA.

Cytokinesis requires a complex network of equatorial and global proteins to 
regulate cell shape changes. Here, using interaction genetics, we report the 
first characterization of a novel protein, enlazin. Enlazin is a natural fusion 
of two canonical classes of actin-associated proteins, the ezrin-radixin-moesin 
family and fimbrin, and it is localized to actin-rich structures. A fragment of 
enlazin, enl-tr, was isolated as a genetic suppressor of the cytokinesis defect 
of cortexillin-I mutants. Expression of enl-tr disrupts expression of endogenous 
enlazin, indicating that enl-tr functions as a dominant-negative lesion. Enlazin 
is distributed globally during cytokinesis and is required for cortical tension 
and cell adhesion. Consistent with a role in cell mechanics, inhibition of 
enlazin in a cortexillin-I background restores cytokinesis furrowing dynamics 
and suppresses the growth-in-suspension defect. However, as expected for a role 
in cell adhesion, inhibiting enlazin in a myosin-II background induces a 
synthetic cytokinesis phenotype, frequently arresting furrow ingression at the 
dumbbell shape and/or causing recession of the furrow. Thus, enlazin has roles 
in cell mechanics and adhesion, and these roles seem to be differentially 
significant for cytokinesis, depending on the genetic background.

BACKGROUND: Patients with leprosy can present with systemic inflammatory 
complications called leprosy reactions (LR), which can be severe and cause a 
loss of nerve function. The treatment of choice is prolonged corticosteroid 
therapy, frequently associated with severe side effects. We have used 
methotrexate as a corticosteroid-sparing regimen with good results.
METHODS: To evaluate the role of methotrexate in managing LR, we performed a 
systematic review of the literature including our cases. We evaluated studies, 
prospective and retrospective, in both adults and children, which included any 
dose/regimen of methotrexate for the treatment of LR type 1 or 2.
RESULTS: The systematic search revealed 261 records that yield 21 patients 
including our 3 cases (19 adults/two children), who were treated with 
methotrexate for LR type 1 and 2. There were 14 males. Median age was 35 years 
(P25-P75 28 to 52). Patients showed lepromatous (7), borderline lepromatous (9) 
or borderline tuberculoid (3) leprosy, among the 19 cases in which the type of 
leprosy was specified. As for the type of LR, 15 patients showed erythema 
nodosum leprosum (ENL), five showed LR type 1 and one showed polyarthritis and 
previous ENL. Methotrexate at weekly doses ranging from 7.5 mg to 20 mg (median 
15 mg per week), typically administered with low-dose corticosteroids, was 
effective and safe as a corticosteroid-sparing agent.
CONCLUSIONS: Methotrexate could be a suitable ancillary treatment or alternative 
to corticosteroids, especially in populations who are more prone to its adverse 
events. However, this evidence is based only on case reports and short clinical 
series.

[A study of captopril enhancement of nitrate effect coronary arterial disease 
patients associated with heart failure].

[Article in Chinese]

It is shown in a prospective study that the initial beneficial hemodynamic 
effect of nitroglycerine (NTG) significantly decreased after continuous 3-day 
infusion of this drug (10-50 micrograms/min) in acute myocardial infarction 
(AMI) patients associated with acute left heart failure. The effect of 
ameliorating anginapectoris and improving heart function with isosorbide 
dinitrate (ISDN) gradually decreased almost to pretreatment levels after oral 
administration of this drug (10-20mg, 4 times daily) for 3 weeks in 
anginapectoris patients associated with congestive heart failure (CHF) with 
accompanying increased level of plasma angiotensin II (AII) and body weight. 
However, when captopril (CPT, 12.5-25mg, 3 times daily) was combined with 
nitrates, the clinical effects were enhanced and maintained throughout the 
study, along with a decrease in the level of AII and body weight. In the hearts 
of rats perfused with CPT and NTG, the coronary flow (CF) significantly 
increased as compared with the flow when either drug was used alone. Enelapril 
(ENL, a non-sulfhydryl drug), however, did not show such effect. The above 
results indicate that repletion of sulfhydryl to vascular smooth muscle and 
antineurohumoral activation may be the potential mechanisms by which CPT 
reverses nitrate tolerance and enhances its clinical effects.

A study of blood ascorbic acid in leprosy.

Sinha SN, Gupta SC, Bajaj AK, Singh PA, Kumar P.

The basal level of blood ascorbic acid was studied in 70 cases of polar leprosy. 
The level was found to be significantly reduced in both polar types, more so in 
tuberculoid. In untreated cases of these two polar forms, the differences were 
highly significant. No significant differences were found between untreated and 
treated cases of either form of leprosy, indicating that dapsone (DDS) has no 
effect on the ascorbic acid level. In lepromatous leprosy, the level was not 
affected by erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL). The deficiency of ascorbic acid in 
leprosy might be due to the disease per se and/or associated with nutritional 
factors. In trophic ulcers after supplement therapy for 60 days, the low level 
of ascorbic acid became close to the control group with marked improvement in 
the healing of the ulcers clinically. In addition, lactic and pyruvic acids were 
also measured and found to be significantly raised. After ascorbic acid 
supplement, the levels fell to near the control values, indicating that ascorbic 
acid played a role in controlling the infection as well as possible thiamine 
deficiency and also checked the disturbance caused by DDS on lactate and 
pyruvate metabolism. The present study suggested that supplementing DDS therapy 
with ascorbic acid might provide a beneficial effect on the general condition of 
the leprosy patients and the early healing of trophic ulcers.

Leprosy reactions are acute immunological events that occur during the evolution 
of chronic infectious disease causing neural damage and disabilities. A study 
using blood samples of 17 leprosy reaction patients and 17 reaction-free was 
carried out by means of associations between antigens, receptors, and expression 
of cytokines, using path analysis providing new insights into the immunological 
mechanisms involved in triggering leprosy reactions. Toll-like receptors (TLR) 
such as TLR1 and TLR2, presented balanced expression in the reaction-free 
multibacillary (MB) group (TLR1: 1.01 ± 0.23, TLR2: 1.22 ± 0.18; p = 0.267). On 
the other hand, downgrading type 1 reaction (T1R) (TLR1: 1.24 ± 0.17, TLR2: 2.88 
± 0.37; p = 0.002) and erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) (TLR1: 1.93 ± 0.17, TLR2: 
2.81 ± 0.15; p = 0.004) revealed an unbalance in relation to the expression of 
these receptors. When the path analysis was approached, it was noted that 
interleukin 10 (IL-10) expression showed a dependence relation with phenolic 
glycolipid I (PGL-I) in downgrading T1R (direct effect = 0.503 > residual effect 
= 0.364), whereas in ENL, such relationship occurred with lipoarabinomannan 
(LAM) (direct effect = 0.778 > residual effect = 0.280). On the contrary, in the 
reaction-free leprosy group, interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) levels were dependent on 
the association between TLR2 and TLR1 (0.8735). The high TLR2 expression 
associated with IL-10 levels, in the leprosy reaction groups, may be 
hypothetically related to the formation of TLR2/2 homodimers and/or TLR2/6 
heterodimers linked to evasion mechanisms in downgrading reactions and 
pathophysiology of ENL.

Phase image in Fourier domain Doppler optical coherence tomography offers 
additional flow information of investigated samples, which provides valuable 
evidence towards accurate medical diagnosis. High quality phase images are thus 
desirable. We propose a noise reduction method for phase images by combining a 
synthetic noise estimation criteria based on local noise estimator (LNE) and 
distance median value (DMV) with anisotropic diffusion model. By identifying 
noise and signal pixels accurately and diffusing them with different 
coefficients respectively and adaptive iteration steps, we demonstrated the 
effectiveness of our proposed method in both phantom and mouse artery images. 
Comparison with other methods such as filtering method (mean, median filtering), 
wavelet method, probabilistic method and partial differential equation based 
methods in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), equivalent number of 
looks (ENL) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) showed the advantages of our 
method in reserving image energy and removing noise.

Saudi Arabia.

BACKGROUND: Panniculitides are well-recognized clinicopathologic entities but 
the non-specificity of their clinical and pathological features often troubles 
the diagnostician.
METHODS: This study retrospectively evaluates the clinical overlaps and the 
significance of histological findings among various panniculitides.
RESULTS: The clinical evaluation in 55 panniculitides cases suggested the 
diagnosis of typical erythema nodosum (EN) in 26 cases, atypical EN in 17 cases, 
atypical nodular vasculitis (NV) in two cases, soft tissue infection in five 
cases and five cases remained unclassified. Skin biopsy evaluation provided 
definite panniculitis diagnosis in 53 cases including EN (28 cases), 
leukocytoclastic vasculitis (seven cases), NV (four cases), superficial 
thrombophlebitis (ST) (two cases), eosinophillic panniculitis (EP) (three 
cases), infection-related panniculitis (five cases), and one case each of 
erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL), lupus panniculitis (LP), pancreatic fat 
necrosis and acne conglobata with two cases remaining unclassified. 
Histologically, 'predominantly septal' and 'mixed panniculitis' were the chief 
inflammatory patterns in EN cases, while mixed panniculitis was seen in most LCV 
cases and predominantly lobular and mixed panniculitis in NV cases.
CONCLUSIONS: Biopsy evaluation of a panniculitis lesion is usually significant, 
and the application of a combination of histologic features rather than of a 
single biopsy finding or an inflammatory pattern is helpful in the diagnosis of 
panniculitis.

The etiology of human tumors often involves chromosomal translocations. Models 
that emulate translocations are essential to understanding the determinants of 
frank malignancy, those dictating the restriction of translocations to specific 
lineages, and as a basis for development of rational therapeutic methods. We 
demonstrate that developmentally regulated Cre-loxP-mediated interchromosomal 
recombination between the Mll gene, whose human counterpart is involved in a 
spectrum of leukemias, and the Enl gene creates reciprocal chromosomal 
translocations that cause myeloid tumors. There is a rapid onset and high 
penetrance of leukemogenesis in these translocator mice, and high proportions of 
cells carrying chromosomal translocations can be found in bone marrow as early 
as 12 days after birth. This de novo strategy is a direct recapitulation of 
naturally occurring human cancer-associated translocations.

The aim of this study was to assess accuracy of the three most commonly used 
continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems in almost real-life situation during 
a diabetes camp in children with type 1 diabetes (T1D) aged 9-14 years. Data was 
gathered during a 2-week summer camp under physicians' supervision. Out of 38 
participating children with T1D (aged: 11.0 [9.9; 12.1] years; 57% girls, mean 
HbA1c 7.2 [6.9; 7.7] %,) 37 wore a CGM system (either Abbott FreeStyle Libre 
(FSL), Dexcom G6 (DEX) or Medtronic Enlite (ENL)) throughout the camp. All 
concomitantly available data pairs of capillary glucose measurements and sensor 
values were used for the analysis. Mean absolute relative difference (MARD) was 
calculated and Parkes Error Grid analyses were done for all three systems used. 
In total 2079 data pairs were available for analysis. The overall MARDs of CGM 
systems used at the camp was FSL: 13.3% (6.7;21.6). DEX: 10.3% (5.8; 16.7) and 
ENL 8.5% (3.6; 15.6). During eu-, hypo- and hyperglycemia MARDs were lowest in 
ENL. Highest MARDs were seen in hypoglycemia, where all three systems exhibited 
MARDs above 15%. Overnight MARDs of all systems was higher than during daytime. 
All sensors performed worst in hypoglycemia. Performance of the adequately 
calibrated Medtronic system outperformed the factory-calibrated sensors. For 
clinical practice, it is important to adequately train children with T1D and 
families in the correct procedures for sensors that require calibrations.

Chemical probes of epigenetic 'readers' of histone post-translational 
modifications (PTMs) have become powerful tools for mechanistic and functional 
studies of their target proteins in normal physiology and disease pathogenesis. 
Here we report the development of the first class of chemical probes of YEATS 
domains, newly identified 'readers' of histone lysine acetylation (Kac) and 
crotonylation (Kcr). Guided by the structural analysis of a YEATS-Kcr complex, 
we developed a series of peptide-based inhibitors of YEATS domains by targeting 
a unique π-π-π stacking interaction at the proteins' Kcr recognition site. 
Further structure optimization resulted in the selective inhibitors 
preferentially binding to individual YEATS-containing proteins including AF9 and 
ENL with submicromolar affinities. We demonstrate that one of the ENL 
YEATS-selective inhibitors, XL-13m, engages with endogenous ENL, perturbs the 
recruitment of ENL onto chromatin, and synergizes the BET and DOT1L 
inhibition-induced downregulation of oncogenes in MLL-rearranged acute leukemia.

The opportunistic exchange of information between vehicles can significantly 
contribute to reducing the occurrence of accidents and mitigating their damages. 
However, in urban environments, especially at intersection scenarios, obstacles 
such as buildings and walls block the line of sight between the transmitter and 
receiver, reducing the vehicular communication range and thus harming the 
performance of road safety applications. Furthermore, the sizes of the 
surrounding vehicles and weather conditions may affect the communication. This 
makes communications in urban V2V communication scenarios extremely difficult. 
Since the late notification of vehicles or incidents can lead to the loss of 
human lives, this paper focuses on improving urban vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) 
communications at intersections by using a transmission scheme able of adapting 
to the surrounding environment. Therefore, we proposed a neuroevolution of 
augmenting topologies-based adaptive beamforming scheme to control the radiation 
pattern of an antenna array and thus mitigate the effects generated by shadowing 
in urban V2V communication at intersection scenarios. This work considered the 
IEEE 802.11p standard for the physical layer of the vehicular communication 
link. The results show that our proposal outperformed the isotropic antenna in 
terms of the communication range and response time, as well as other traditional 
machine learning approaches, such as genetic algorithms and mutation 
strategy-based particle swarm optimization.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the occurrence and characteristics of the two types of 
lepra reactions in new leprosy cases at initial diagnosis.
METHODS: The retrospective descriptive study was conducted at the Marie Adelaide 
Leprosy Centre, Karachi, and comprised all new leprosy cases registered from 
January 1, 2016, to June 30, 2018. Data was collected from the medical record 
database using a predesigned proforma.
RESULTS: Of the 50 cases, 2(4%) were children and 48 (96%) were adults, with 
overall age ranging from 12 to 85 years. There were 41(82%) males and 9(18%) 
females.. Of the total, 30(60%) cases presented with type 1 reaction and 20(40%) 
with type 2. Further, 30(60%) cases were classified as borderline lepromatous. 
Among them, 17(57%) had type 2 reaction. Inflamed plaques were the main feature 
in 27(90%) cases of type 1. Crops of painful, erythematous nodules were seen in 
19(95%) cases of type 2.
CONCLUSION: Lepra reactions were found to be a presenting feature in a 
significant number of new leprosy cases at initial diagnosis.

Florid reactive periostitis ossificans is a rare bone lesion usually occurring 
in the small, tubular bones of the hands and feet. This entity is a benign and 
aggressive periosteal reaction associated with soft tissue swelling that appears 
similar to a bone lesion that radiographically and clinically mimics an 
infectious or neoplastic process. Typically the lesions occurs in an adolescent 
or young adult and presents as a small area of painful swelling and erythema 
over the affected bone. The cause of florid reactive periostitis ossificans is 
not exactly known though many authors have postulated varied etiopathogenesis 
for the same condition. In this report, is a very rare and unusual example of 
this entity that has been observed in association with erythema nodosum leprosum 
(ENL) a type 2 lepra reaction in a Leprosy patient.

human intestinal bacteria.

BACKGROUND: The effects of enterolignans, e.g., enterodiol (END) and 
particularly its oxidation product, enterolactone (ENL), on prevention of 
hormone-dependent diseases, such as osteoporosis, cardiovascular diseases, 
hyperlipemia, breast cancer, colon cancer, prostate cancer and menopausal 
syndrome, have attracted much attention. To date, the main way to obtain END and 
ENL is chemical synthesis, which is expensive and inevitably leads to 
environmental pollution. To explore a more economic and eco-friendly production 
method, we explored biotransformation of enterolignans from precursors contained 
in defatted flaxseeds by human intestinal bacteria.
RESULTS: We cultured fecal specimens from healthy young adults in media 
containing defatted flaxseeds and detected END from the culture supernatant. 
Following selection through successive subcultures of the fecal microbiota with 
defatted flaxseeds as the only carbon source, we obtained a bacterial 
consortium, designated as END-49, which contained the smallest number of 
bacterial types still capable of metabolizing defatted flaxseeds to produce END. 
Based on analysis with pulsed field gel electrophoresis, END-49 was found to 
consist of five genomically distinct bacterial lineages, designated Group I-V, 
with Group I strains dominating the culture. None of the individual Group I-V 
strains produced END, demonstrating that the biotransformation of substrates in 
defatted flaxseeds into END is a joint work by different members of the END-49 
bacterial consortium. Interestingly, Group I strains produced 
secoisolariciresinol, an important intermediate of END production; 16S rRNA 
analysis of one Group I strain established its close relatedness with 
Klebsiella. Genomic analysis is under way to identify all members in END-49 
involved in the biotransformation and the actual pathway leading to 
END-production.
CONCLUSION: Biotransformation is a very economic, efficient and environmentally 
friendly way of mass-producing enterodiol from defatted flaxseeds.

The mixed-lineage leukemia fusion partner AF4 stimulates RNA polymerase II 
transcriptional elongation and mediates coordinated chromatin remodeling.

3QX, UK.

AF4 gene, frequently translocated with mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) in childhood 
acute leukemia, encodes a putative transcriptional activator of the 
AF4/LAF4/FMR2 (ALF) protein family previously implicated in lymphopoiesis and 
Purkinje cell function in the cerebellum. Here, we provide the first evidence 
for a direct role of AF4 in the regulation of transcriptional elongation by RNA 
polymerase II (Pol II). We demonstrate that mouse Af4 functions as a positive 
regulator of Pol II transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) kinase and, in 
complex with MLL fusion partners Af9, Enl and Af10, as a mediator of histone 
H3-K79 methylation by recruiting Dot1 to elongating Pol II. These pathways are 
interconnected and tightly regulated by the P-TEFb-dependent phosphorylation of 
Af4, Af9 and Enl which controls their transactivation activity and/or protein 
stability. Consistently, increased levels of phosphorylated Pol II and 
methylated H3-K79 are observed in the ataxic mouse mutant robotic, an 
over-expression model of Af4. Finally, we confirm the functional relevance of 
Af4, Enl and Af9 to the regulation of gene transcription as their 
over-expression strongly stimulates P-TEFb-dependent transcription of a 
luciferase reporter gene. Our findings uncover a central role for these proteins 
in the regulation of transcriptional elongation and coordinated histone 
methylation, providing valuable insight into their contribution to 
leukemogenesis and neurodegeneration. Since these activities likely extend to 
the entire ALF protein family, this study also significantly inputs our 
understanding of the molecular basis of FRAXE mental retardation syndrome in 
which FMR2 expression is silenced.

Flt3 does not play a critical role in murine myeloid leukemias induced by MLL 
fusion genes.

Author information:

Leukemias harboring MLL translocations are frequent in children and adults, and 
respond poorly to therapies. The receptor tyrosine kinase FLT3 is highly 
expressed in these leukemias. In vitro studies have shown that pediatric 
MLL-rearranged ALL cells are sensitive to FLT3 inhibitors and clinical trials 
are ongoing to measure their therapeutic efficacy. We sought to determine the 
contribution of Flt3 in the pathogenesis of MLL-rearranged leukemias using a 
myeloid leukemia mouse model. Bone marrow from Flt3 null mice transduced with 
MLL-ENL or MLL-CBP was transplanted into host mice and Flt3 (-/-) leukemias were 
compared to their Flt3 wild type counterparts. Flt3 deficiency did not delay 
disease onset and had minimal impact on leukemia characteristics. To determine 
the anti-leukemic effect of FLT3 inhibition we studied the sensitivity of 
MLL-ENL leukemia cells to the FLT3 inhibitor PKC412 ex vivo. As previously 
reported for human MLL-rearranged leukemias, murine MLL-ENL leukemia cells with 
higher Flt3 levels were more sensitive to the cytotoxicity of PKC412. 
Interestingly, Flt3 deficient leukemia samples also displayed some sensitivity 
to PKC412. Our findings demonstrate that myeloid leukemias induced by 
MLL-rearranged genes are not dependent upon Flt3 signaling. They also highlight 
the discrepancy between the sensitivity of cells to Flt3 inhibition in vitro and 
the lack of contribution of Flt3 to the pathogenesis of MLL-rearranged leukemias 
in vivo.

INTRODUCTION: Leprosy is a disease primarily affecting skin and nerve. Nail 
involvement, although indirect, is observed in several patients. This is a study 
to determine the pattern of nail changes in leprosy.
METHODS: It was an observational study involving 125 patients. Apart from 
cutaneous and neurological examination, nails were examined. Diagnosis was 
confirmed by previous records in already diagnosed cases, while by slit skin 
smear and histopathologically in new cases. Patients were grouped as per 
Ridley-Jopling classification and further subdivided as per age, sex, and 
duration and reaction status. Nail changes in these groups were summarized and 
compared.
RESULTS: Overall prevalence of nail changes was 80% with 66.6% in TT patients, 
79.4% in BT patients 50% in BB patients, 83.7% in BL patients and 84.3% in LL 
patients. Longitudinal melanonychia and longitudinal ridges were frequent finger 
nail changes with longitudinal melanonychia being more common among tuberculoid 
pole and longitudinal ridges among lepromatous pole. Brachyonychia, subungual 
hyperkeratosis and brown black pigmentation were frequent finger nail changes, 
with onychorrhexis being commonest among TT patients, subungual hyperkeratosis 
among BT patients, while brachyonychia among BL and LL patients. Anonychia and 
rudimentary nails were not found in tuberculoid pole. Beau's lines, terry nails, 
pterygium, pincer nail, and onychorrhexis were significantly more frequent in 
ENL patients. Onychomadesis, which is not reported yet in leprosy, was found in 
one patient after severe ENL.
CONCLUSION: Various changes in leprosy are due to multiple causes like 
neuropathic, traumatic, vascular, osseous, infections and drugs reflecting 
extensive systemic morbidity caused by Mycobacterium leprae.

Once monthly rifampicin (1200 mg) plus daily dapsone (100 mg) and clofazimine 
(100 mg) in the initial treatment of lepromatous leprosy.

Chandorkar AG, Burte NP, Gade RK, Bulakh PM.

The therapeutic effect of rifampicin 1200 mg once monthly and 100 mg clofazimine 
daily for the first six months of treatment was evaluated in 30 patients of 
bacteriologically positive lepromatous leprosy patients. Moderate to marked 
clinical improvement was seen in all the patients and a very rapid 
bacteriological regression as indicated by the decrease in bacteriological and 
morphological indices of the skin within one week. Seven patients become MI 
negative at one month and three months and 13 at the end of nine months. Two 
patients became MI and BI negative at the end of six months and six at the end 
of nine months. These observations clearly establish the high therapeutic 
efficacy and practicability of the three drug regimen. Once monthly rifampicin 
is highly effective and well tolerated, and has many advantages like low cost, 
better patient compliance and reliability of the treatment. Addition of 
clofazimine to rifampicin and dapsone prevents the emergence of E.N.L. reactions 
which were seen during treatment with once monthly rifampicin and daily dapsone. 
This regimen is thus ideal for initial, intensive treatment of lepromatous 
leprosy and may help in preventing the spread of the disease and development of 
dapsone resistance.

Erythema Nodosum Leprosum (ENL) occurs due to the immunological complication of 
multibacillary leprosy and is characterized by painful nodules and systemic 
compromising. It is usually recurrent and/or chronic and has both physical and 
economic impact on the patient, being a very important cause of disability. In 
addition, ENL is a major health problem in countries where leprosy is endemic. 
Therefore, adequate control of this condition is important. The management of 
ENL aims to control acute inflammation and neuritis and prevent the onset of new 
episodes. However, all currently available treatment modalities have one or two 
drawbacks and are not effective for all patients. Corticosteroid is the 
anti-inflammatory of choice in ENL but may cause dependence, especially for 
chronic patients. Thalidomide has a rapid action but its use is limited due the 
teratogenicity and neurotoxicity. Clofazimine and pentoxifylline have slow 
action and have important adverse effects. Finally, there is no pattern or 
guidelines for treating these patients, becoming more difficult to evaluate and 
to control this condition. This review aims to show the main drugs used in the 
treatment of ENL and the challenges in the management of the reaction.

Treatment with thalidomide in steroid dependency and neuritis.

Theophilus S.

Thalidomide is found effective and useful in cases of lepromatous ENL in 
Corticosteroid dependent cases which had been on treatment with dapsone and 
lamprene. But eventually due to recurrence these cases had to be put back on 
steroids because of easier availability. Cases of neuritis responded much more 
satisfactorily and there was no change in the muscle deficity before or after 
treatment with thalidomide.

Type 2 leprosy reaction, or erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL), involves a complex 
interaction between the host's immune system and Mycobacterium leprae. It may 
occur before, during, or after treatment and have a variable clinical 
presentation involving different body systems, such as skin, osteoarticular, 
kidneys, and others. Thus, the differential diagnosis, depending on its clinical 
presentation, can be broad and challenging. The authors report a case of a 
severe monoarthritis during a type 2 reaction after the multidrug therapy (MDT) 
was discharged and the investigation of the differential diagnoses.

Clinical evidence of pharmacokinetic changes in thalidomide therapy.

Nagoya City University, Nagoya, Japan.

The teratogenic effects of thalidomide have been studied for more than 50 years. 
However, there have been few studies of the pharmacokinetic changes occurring 
during thalidomide therapy. Thalidomide was originally developed as a sedative. 
However, thalidomide induces multiple birth defects when used in pregnant women. 
Thalidomide is now used in the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM) and erythema 
nodosum leprosum (ENL) in Japan. Rational use of thalidomide is problematic due 
to a lack of basic research regarding its mechanism of action and serum 
concentration/effect relationships. There are a number of hypotheses for 
pharmacokinetic changes in thalidomide therapy. Genetic factors including single 
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that change cytochrome P450 (CYP) activity and 
epigenetic regulation that modifies CYP expression levels may contribute to the 
changes in pharmacokinetics and adverse drug reactions (ADRs) of thalidomide. 
Environmental factors include the pharmacological context of drug-drug 
interactions and the physiological context of liver diseases. Liver and kidney 
diseases do not play important roles in pharmacokinetic changes or ADRs in 
thalidomide therapy. To date, most research has focused on teratogenic activity, 
while the impact of polymorphisms in genes encoding drug metabolic enzymes and 
drug-drug interactions could mediate ADRs. Here, we discuss clinical evidence of 
pharmacokinetic changes in thalidomide therapy.

Hepatic and peripheral glucose metabolism in intensive care patients receiving 
continuous high- or low-carbohydrate enteral nutrition.

E, Chioléro R.

BACKGROUND: The suppression of endogenous glucose production during parenteral 
nutrition is impaired in critically ill patients. It is, however, unknown 
whether enteral administration of carbohydrates, which normally promote hepatic 
glucose uptake, improves hepatic glucose metabolism in such patients.
METHODS: We studied two groups of 7 patients during a 3-day continuous 
isocaloric enteral nutrition. A high-carbohydrate, low-lipid (EN-C) or a 
high-lipid, low-carbohydrate (EN-L) nutrient mixture was administered.
RESULTS: Endogenous glucose production assessed with [2H7]glucose was similarly 
increased in both groups, indicating absence of its suppression by carbohydrate 
feeding. Gluconeogenesis estimated from [13C]glucose synthesis during 
[13C]bicarbonate infusion also was not suppressed by EN-C compared with EN-L. 
Systemic appearance of exogenous glucose was monitored by enteral infusion of 
[6,6-2H]glucose and was not different from the rate of glucose equivalent 
administered enterally, indicating no significant hepatic uptake of glucose in 
both groups. Plasma glucose and insulin concentrations were slightly higher with 
EN-C, although not significantly, and plasma triglycerides were similar in both 
groups. Both nutrition formulas were well tolerated clinically.
CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that enteral carbohydrate administration, 
whatever its quantity, fails to suppress endogenous glucose production and to 
promote net splanchnic glucose uptake in critically ill patients.

Lignans and flavonoids inhibit aromatase enzyme in human preadipocytes.

Lignans and flavonoids are naturally-occurring diphenolic compounds found in 
high concentrations in whole grains, legumes, fruits and vegetables. Seven 
lignans and six flavonoids were evaluated for their abilities to inhibit 
aromatase enzyme activity in a human preadipose cell culture system. The lignan, 
enterolactone (Enl) and its theoretical precursors, 
3'-demethoxy-3O-demethylmatairesinol (DMDM) and didemethoxymatairesinol (DDMM) 
decreased aromatase enzyme activity, with Ki values of 14.4, 5.0 and 7.3 microM, 
respectively. The flavonoids, coumestrol, luteolin and kaempferol also decreased 
aromatase enzyme activity, with Ki values of 1.3, 4.8 and 27.2 microM, 
respectively. Aminoglutethimide, a pharmaceutical aromatase inhibitor, showed a 
Ki value of 0.5 microM. Kinetic studies showed the inhibition by all compounds 
to be competitive. Smaller decreases in aromatase activity were observed with 
the lignan, enterodiol (End) and its theoretical precursors, 
O-demethylsecoisolariciresinol (ODSI), demethoxysecoisolariciresinol (DMSI) and 
didemethylsecoisolariciresinol (DDSI). The flavonoids, O-demethylangolensin 
(O-Dma), fisetin and morin showed no inhibitory effects. The inhibition of human 
preadipocyte aromatase activity by lignans and flavonoids suggests a mechanism 
by which consumption of lignan- and flavonoid-rich plant foods may contribute to 
reduction of estrogen-dependent disease, such as breast cancer.

leprosy patients.

The present study analyzes some clinical and immunological aspects of the giant 
reaction (GR) in lepromatous leprosy. Sixteen out of a total of 147 (10.9%) 
lepromatous patients developed the clinical features of GR upon the intradermal 
administration of PPD; most (14 of 16) GRs occurred in bacteriologically 
positive cases. GR precipitated an episode of erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) in 
three patients. In addition, patients with GR showed enhanced in vitro response 
to PPD, by the lymphoproliferation test and interferon-gamma assay, as compared 
to either PPD-negative individuals or PPD-positive patients without GR. 
Therefore, cell-mediated-immune response to mycobacterial antigens is present in 
lepromatous patients with GR. It is suggested that the exacerbated in vivo 
response to PPD in lepromatous leprosy is the result of an increased 
immunoreactivity to the antigen, which well may be associated with the local 
and/or systemic release of cytokines [tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha) 
and interferon-gamma (IFN gamma)] by the inflammatory cells. These episodes may, 
in fact, play an important role in determining the development of disabilities 
and reactional states, thereby interfering with the prognosis of leprosy 
disease.

Leprosy reactions are acute inflammatory episodes that complicate the course of 
a Mycobacterium leprae infection and are the major cause of leprosy-associated 
pathology. Two types of leprosy reactions with relatively distinct pathogenesis 
and clinical features can occur: type 1 reaction, also known as reversal 
reaction, and type 2 reaction, also known as erythema nodosum leprosum. These 
acute nerve-destructive immune exacerbations often cause irreversible 
disabilities and deformities, especially when diagnosis is delayed. However, 
there is no diagnostic test to detect or predict leprosy reactions before the 
onset of clinical symptoms. Identification of biomarkers for leprosy reactions, 
which impede the development of symptoms or correlate with early-onset, will 
allow precise diagnosis and timely interventions to greatly improve the 
patients' quality of life. Here, we review the progress of research aimed at 
identifying biomarkers for leprosy reactions, including its correlation with not 
only immunity but also genetics, transcripts, and metabolites, providing an 
understanding of the immune dysfunction and inflammation that underly the 
pathogenesis of leprosy reactions. Nevertheless, no biomarkers that can reliably 
predict the subsequent occurrence of leprosy reactions from non-reactional 
patients and distinguish type I reaction from type II have yet been found.

Thalidomide is increasingly being used due to its effectiveness in the treatment 
of a variety of dermatologic conditions refractory to other treatments. Although 
thalidomide's side effects have been well-documented in the literature since its 
entry in the 1950s, some of the risks associated with its use are still being 
discovered. Recently, increased incidence of venous thrombosis following 
thalidomide use has been reported in the treatment of diseases with 
disease-related thrombotic risks, such as malignancy and lupus with 
antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, as well as concomitant therapy with 
chemotherapy and/or systemic corticosteroids. We report a case of deep venous 
thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolus (PE) following thalidomide use in a 
patient with leprosy (erythema nodosum leprosum, ENL) who was concurrently 
treated with prednisone, as well as a review of relevant literature. Our 
findings substantiate an increase in risk for thrombosis following thalidomide 
use in the dermatology and non-cancer clinical setting.

Specificity of lymphocytotoxic autoantibodies (LCAbs) found in the serum of 
leprosy patients: class I MHC antigens.

Medicine, England.

Lymphocytotoxic autoantibodies (LCAbs) of the IgM class have been identified in 
patients with borderline tuberculoid (BT) and borderline lepromatous (BL) 
leprosy with Type I reactions (I) as well as lepromatous leprosy (LL) patients 
with erythema nodosum leprosum reactions (ENL). The observation that 
lymphocytotoxic activity (LCA) was reduced in the presence of platelets led us 
to determine whether LCAbs had specificities for Class I Major 
Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) determinants. Absorption of LCA positive sera 
with platelets, classically used to deplete Class I specific lymphocytotoxic 
antibodies, reduced LCA towards autologous as well as allogeneic target cells. 
This was true for LCA positive sera from all patient classifications (group BT 
in the autologous system, p less than 0.01; in all other patient groups, p less 
than 0.001). Introducing B-2m to cytotoxicity assays only marginally reduced LCA 
when added at high concentrations (5 mg/ml). An anti-Class I MHC antiserum which 
blocked the lytic activity. The data indicate that LCAbs while absorbed by 
platelets, are not specific for the Class I MHC antigens. The autoantigen 
recognized by these autoantibodies therefore remains to be identified.

A study of leprosy in relation with HBsAg.

Jain AP, Gupta OP, Jajoo UN, Kumar K.

In the present study presence of HBsAg in the serum of 130 leprosy patients (LL 
50; ENL 30; TT 50) and its relationship with various complications has been 
studied. The HBsAg positivity in controls and various types of leprosy did not 
show any significant difference. Similarly complication also had no relation 
with HBsAg positivity. So we conclude that leprosy has no relation with HBsAg.

INTRODUCTION: Leprosy is a chronic granulomatous infectious disease, which is 
caused by Mycobacterium leprae. High numbers of people are still affected by 
this disease in some of the developing countries however, it is rarely seen in 
non-endemic regions. Cutaneous and neurological manifestations are the common 
and classical presentations of leprosy. Musculoskeletal involvement is the third 
most common manifestation but is less frequently reported. Joint involvement can 
present as acute symmetrical polyarthritis or chronic polyarthritis resembling 
rheumatoid arthritis. Leprosy can also present with tenosynovitis, either 
isolated or associated with arthritis.
CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of 29-year-old man who developed 
tenosynovitis and acute symmetrical polyarthritis including small joints of 
hands and feet three weeks after appearance of typical cutaneous lesion of 
leprosy. Patient improved with steroid and anti leprosy treatment. Patient had 
another acute episode with symmetrical polyarthritis four months later while on 
treatment.
DISCUSSION AND EVALUATION: In the modern era, there is increase movement of 
population from developing countries to developed countries, it is likely that 
patient suffering from leprosy with arthritis may present to rheumatology clinic 
in those countries where leprosy is not endemic. Exact pathogenesis for 
musculoskeletal manifestations is still not fully known. Our patient presented 
with symmetrical polyarthritis, enthesitis and systemic involvement, which was 
secondary to lepra reaction. Having good knowledge of musculoskeletal 
manifestation of leprosy, will help narrow differential diagnosis and will 
prevent unnecessary diagnostic workup.
CONCLUSION: Leprosy can present with different rheumatologic manifestation 
including tenosynovitis and acute symmetrical polyarthritis. Type 2 lepra 
reaction (Erythema nodosum leprosum ENL) can present with systemic manifestation 
and can involve skin, nerves, joints, kidneys and liver.

Gene amplification, which is generally considered to occur late in tumor 
development, is a common feature of high grade glioma. Up until now, there have 
been no reports on amplification in astrocytoma grade I. In this study, we 
report cloning and sequencing of a cDNA termed glioma-amplified sequence (GAS41) 
which was identified recently in a glioblastoma cell line by 
microdissection-mediated cDNA capture. This technique is tailored to isolate 
amplified genes from human tumors. An increased copy number of GAS41 was found 
in glioblastoma multiforme and astrocytoma III, and at a high frequency in 
astrocytoma grades I and II. Sequence comparison indicates a high homology 
between the GAS41 protein, the yeast and human AF-9 and the human ENL proteins. 
Both AF-9 and ENL belong to a new class of transcription factors, indicating 
that GAS41 might also represent a transcription factor. With GAS41 being the 
first gene found with increased copy number in low grade glioma, this study 
provides the first evidence that gene amplification can occur in early tumor 
development.

T-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (T-ALL/LBL) accounts for approximately 15% of 
pediatric and 25% of adult ALL. While the underlying frequency of KMT2A (MLL) 
gene rearrangements has been identified in approximately 4-8% of T-ALL/LBL 
cases, a paucity of literature is available to characterize further the KMT2A 
rearrangements in pediatric/young adult T-ALL/LBL. A 10-year retrospective 
review was performed to identify KMT2A rearrangements in specimens sent for 
T-ALL/LBL fluorescence in situ hybridization studies in patients under the age 
of 30 years. Of 806 T-ALL/LBL FISH studies performed on unique individuals, 27 
(3.3%) harbored KMT2A rearrangements. Nineteen patients were male and eight were 
female (M:F ratio, 2.4:1) with ages ranging from 1 to 20 years (mean 12, median 
12). Of the 27 cases, nine (33%) had KMT2A/MLLT1 fusions, eight (30%) had 
KMT2A/AFDN fusions, two (7%) had KMT2A/ELL fusions, and one (4%) had a 
KMT2A/MLLT10 fusion. In addition, five (19%) had KMT2A rearrangements with 
unidentified gene fusion partners and two (7%) had 3'KMT2A deletions. Our 
results indicate that MLLT1 and AFDN account for the majority (63%) of KMT2A 
gene partners in pediatric/young adult T-ALL/LBL, while no KMT2A/AFF1 or 
KMT2A/MLLT3 fusions were observed despite their common identification in B-ALL 
and acute myeloid leukemia, respectively. In addition to diagnostic and 
prognostic value, detecting specific KMT2A fusions may also be of clinical 
importance in the era of targeted therapies.

Mycobacterium leprae (M. leprae) infection causes nerve damage and the condition 
worsens often during and long after treatment. Clearance of bacterial antigens 
including lipoarabinomannan (LAM) during and after treatment in leprosy patients 
is slow. We previously demonstrated that M. leprae LAM damages peripheral nerves 
by in situ generation of the membrane attack complex (MAC). Investigating the 
role of complement activation in skin lesions of leprosy patients might provide 
insight into the dynamics of in situ immune reactivity and the destructive 
pathology of M. leprae. In this study, we analyzed in skin lesions of leprosy 
patients, whether M. leprae antigen LAM deposition correlates with the 
deposition of complement activation products MAC and C3d on nerves and cells in 
the surrounding tissue. Skin biopsies of paucibacillary (n = 7), multibacillary 
leprosy patients (n = 7), and patients with erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) (n = 
6) or reversal reaction (RR) (n = 4) and controls (n = 5) were analyzed. The 
percentage of C3d, MAC and LAM deposition was significantly higher in the skin 
biopsies of multibacillary compared to paucibacillary patients (p = <0.05, p = 
<0.001 and p = <0.001 respectively), with a significant association between LAM 
and C3d or MAC in the skin biopsies of leprosy patients (r = 0.9578, p< 0.0001 
and r = 0.8585, p<0.0001 respectively). In skin lesions of multibacillary 
patients, MAC deposition was found on axons and co-localizing with LAM. In skin 
lesions of paucibacillary patients, we found C3d positive T-cells in and 
surrounding granulomas, but hardly any MAC deposition. In addition, MAC 
immunoreactivity was increased in both ENL and RR skin lesions compared to 
non-reactional leprosy patients (p = <0.01 and p = <0.01 respectively). The 
present findings demonstrate that complement is deposited in skin lesions of 
leprosy patients, suggesting that inflammation driven by complement activation 
might contribute to nerve damage in the lesions of these patients. This should 
be regarded as an important factor in M. leprae nerve damage pathology.

Uncontrolled self-renewal of hematopoietic progenitors induces leukemia. To 
self-renew, leukemia cells must continuously activate genes that were previously 
active in their mother cells. Here, we describe the circuitry of a 
transactivation system responsible for oncogenic self-renewal. MLL recruits RNA 
polymerase II (RNAP2) to unmethylated CpG-rich promoters by its CXXC domain and 
activates transcription by transcriptional regulators, including the AF4 
family/ENL family/P-TEFb complex, DOT1L, and p300/CBP histone acetyl 
transferases. MOZ also targets a broad range of CpG-rich promoters through 
association with RNAP2 and MLL. Leukemic fusion proteins such as MOZ-TIF2 and 
MLL-AFX constitutively activate CpG-rich promoters by aberrantly recruiting 
p300/CBP. Pharmacological inhibition of MLL or DOT1L induces differentiation of 
MOZ-TIF2-transformed cells. These results reveal that activation of unmethylated 
CpG-rich promoters mediated by MLL is the central mechanism of oncogenic 
self-renewal in MOZ-rearranged leukemia and indicate that the molecularly 
targeted therapies intended for MLL-rearranged leukemia can be applied for 
MOZ-rearranged leukemia.

Cytochrome P450c17 (CYP17) has been linked to various hormone-related diseases, 
including breast cancer, thus being a potential target for cancer 
chemoprevention. We studied the naturally occurring phytochemical enterolactone 
(ENL) and 13 VIOXX-related lactone derivatives (CRI-1 to CRI-13) for their 
effects on CYP17 activity and expression and on cell cycle status in the human 
H295R adrenocorticocarcinoma cell line. Of the tested compounds, only CRI-3, -7, 
-10 and -12 showed to be inhibitors of CYP17 activity in H295R cells. This 
inhibition was not due to decreased mRNA expression, but was apparently caused 
by post-translational modification of the CYP17 enzyme. The MAPK kinase (MEK) 
inhibitor PD98059 induced CYP17 activity by 24%, while co-incubation of the 
CRI-s with PD98059, reduced CYP17 activity even further than the reduction 
caused by the CRI-s alone. In addition, CRI-3, -7, -10 and -12 arrested the cell 
cycle in the G(2)/M phase. The structure-activity similarities of the CRI-s with 
known micro-tubule binding agents strongly suggest that cell cycle arrest is a 
result of interaction with tubulin. We conclude that the proposed cancer 
chemopreventive actions of ENL are not mediated through interaction with CYP17 
or cell cycle status. Of the VIOXX-related lactone derivatives, CRI-7 could 
prove useful in the prevention of hormone-dependent cancers, such as breast 
cancer, since in vitro it shows low cytotoxicity, it is a potent inhibitor of 
CYP17 activity and strong inducer of cell cycle arrest.

RATIONALE: Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) are potential tools for smoking 
cessation because they deliver nicotine and simulate smoking behaviors. The 
contribution of sensorimotor versus pharmacological substitution is unknown.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate whether non-nicotinic e-cigarettes, used alone or with 
nicotine lozenges, can attenuate cigarette craving following visual cue 
presentation or acute (3 h post ad-lib use) abstinence in dependent daily 
smokers.
METHODS: Following overnight (12 hours) abstinence, 41 daily smokers were 
exposed to 4 experimental conditions on separate days: (i) tobacco cigarettes 
(CIG); (ii) non-nicotinic e-cigarettes with placebo lozenges (EPL); (iii) 
non-nicotinic e-cigarettes with 4 mg nicotine lozenge (ENL); and (iv) 4 mg 
nicotine lozenge (NL). Cigarette craving was assessed following presentation of 
neutral and smoking cues at various time points using the Brief Questionnaire of 
Smoking Urges (QSU-B) and visual analog scales (VAS).
RESULTS: All experimental conditions significantly reduced participants' 
baseline overnight abstinence cigarette craving. ENLs and NLs attenuated 
smoking-cue-induced cravings to a greater extent than CIGs, where cravings were 
significantly higher with CIGs compared to ENLs [mean difference (MD) ± standard 
error (SE) in QSU-B = 3.2 ± 0.84, P = 0.002; VAS = 12.7 ± 2.7, P < 0.0005] and 
NLs [MD ± SE in QSU-B = 2.7 ± 0.92, P = 0.031; VAS = 8.1 ± 2.3, P = 0.005]. 
Craving responses to cues after 3 h were higher after smoking CIGs compared to 
ENLs [MD ± SE in QSU-B = 3.9 ± 1.4, P = 0.047; VAS = 14.1 ± 3.6, P = 0.002] and 
NLs [MD ± SE in QSU-B = 3.2 ± 1.1, P = 0.046; VAS = 9.7 ± 3.1, P = 0.017].
CONCLUSIONS: Behavioral simulation of smoking with or without nicotine reduces 
nicotine craving. Compared to cigarettes, ENL with NL or NL alone attenuates 
cigarette craving over time. Future clinical trials should evaluate the 
combination of ENL and NL as a method for smoking reduction or cessation.

Aberrant expression of nuclear transporters and deregulated subcellular 
localization of their cargo proteins are emerging as drivers and therapeutic 
targets of cancer. Here, we present evidence that the nuclear exporter 
exportin-6 and its cargo profilin-1 constitute a functionally important and 
frequently deregulated axis in cancer. Exportin-6 upregulation occurs in 
numerous cancer types and is associated with poor patient survival. Reducing 
exportin-6 level in breast cancer cells triggers antitumor effects by 
accumulating nuclear profilin-1. Mechanistically, nuclear profilin-1 interacts 
with eleven-nineteen-leukemia protein (ENL) within the super elongation complex 
(SEC) and inhibits the ability of the SEC to drive transcription of numerous 
pro-cancer genes including MYC. XPO6 and MYC are positively correlated across 
diverse cancer types including breast cancer. Therapeutically, exportin-6 loss 
sensitizes breast cancer cells to the bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) 
inhibitor JQ1. Thus, exportin-6 upregulation is a previously unrecognized cancer 
driver event by spatially inhibiting nuclear profilin-1 as a tumor suppressor.

BACKGROUND: The predictive value of the serology to detection of IgM against the 
Mycobacterium leprae-derived phenolic glycolipid-I/PGL-I to identify leprosy 
patients who are at higher risk of developing reactions remains controversial. 
Whether baseline results of the ML Flow test can predict leprosy reactions was 
investigated among a cohort of patients enrolled in The Clinical Trial for 
Uniform Multidrug Therapy for Leprosy Patients in Brazil (U-MDT/CT-BR).
METHODS: This was a descriptive study focusing on the main clinical 
manifestations of leprosy patients enrolled in the U-MDT/CT-BR from March 2007 
to February 2012 at two Brazilian leprosy reference centers. For research 
purposes, 753 leprosy patients were categorized according to a modified 
Ridley-Jopling (R&J) classification and according to the development of leprosy 
reactions (reversal reaction/RR and erythema nodosum leprosum/ENL), and whether 
they had a positive or negative bacillary index/BI.
RESULTS: More than half of the patients (55.5 %) reported leprosy reaction: 
18.3 % (138/753) had a RR and 5.4 % (41/753) had ENL. Leprosy reactions were 
more frequent in the first year following diagnosis, as seen in 27 % (205/753) 
of patients, while 19 % (142/753) developed reactions during subsequent 
follow-up. Similar frequencies of leprosy reactions and other clinical 
manifestations were observed in paucibacillary (PB) and multibacillary (MB) 
leprosy patients treated with U-MDT and regular MDT (R-MDT) (P = 0.43 and 
P = 0.61, respectively). Compared with PB patients, leprosy reactions were 
significantly more frequent in MB patients with a high BI, and more patients 
developed RR than ENL. However, RR and neuritis were also reported in patients 
with a negative BI. At baseline, the highest rate of ML Flow positivity was 
observed in patients with a positive BI, especially those who developed ENL, 
followed by patients who had neuritis and RR. Among reaction-free patients, 
81.9 % were ML Flow positive, however, the differences were not statistically 
significant compared to reactional patients (P = 0.45).
CONCLUSIONS: MB and PB patients treated with R-MDT and U-MDT showed similar 
frequencies of RR and other clinical manifestations. Positive ML Flow tests were 
associated with MB leprosy and BI positivity. However, ML Flow test results at 
baseline showed limited sensitivity and specificity for predicting the 
development of leprosy reactions.

The chromatin reader eleven-nineteen-leukemia (ENL) has been identified as a 
critical dependency in AML, but its therapeutic potential remains unclear. We 
describe a potent and orally bioavailable small-molecule inhibitor of ENL, 
TDI-11055, which displaces ENL from chromatin by blocking its YEATS domain 
interaction with acylated histones. Cell lines and primary patient samples 
carrying MLL rearrangements or NPM1 mutations are responsive to TDI-11055. A 
CRISPR-Cas9-mediated mutagenesis screen uncovers an ENL mutation that confers 
resistance to TDI-11055, validating the compound's on-target activity. TDI-11055 
treatment rapidly decreases chromatin occupancy of ENL-associated complexes and 
impairs transcription elongation, leading to suppression of key oncogenic gene 
expression programs and induction of differentiation. In vivo treatment with 
TDI-11055 blocks disease progression in cell line and patient-derived xenograft 
models of MLL-rearranged and NPM1-mutated AML. Our results establish ENL 
displacement from chromatin as a promising epigenetic therapy for molecularly 
defined AML subsets and support clinical translation of this approach.

Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a rare and aggressive neoplasm. Patients 
are usually diagnosed when current treatments have limited benefits, 
highlighting the need for noninvasive tests aimed at an MPM risk assessment tool 
that might improve life expectancy. Three hundred asbestos-exposed subjects (163 
MPM cases and 137 cancer-free controls), from the same geographical region in 
Italy, were recruited. The evaluation of asbestos exposure was conducted 
considering the frequency, the duration and the intensity of occupational, 
environmental and domestic exposure. A genome-wide methylation array was 
performed to identify novel blood DNA methylation (DNAm) markers of MPM. 
Multiple regression analyses adjusting for potential confounding factors and 
interaction between asbestos exposure and DNAm on the MPM odds ratio were 
applied. Epigenome-wide analysis (EWAS) revealed 12 single-CpGs associated with 
the disease. Two of these showed high statistical power (99%) and effect size 
(>0.05) after false discovery rate (FDR) multiple comparison corrections: (i) 
cg03546163 in FKBP5, significantly hypomethylated in cases (Mean Difference in 
beta values (MD) = -0.09, 95% CI = -0.12|-0.06, p = 1.2 × 10-7), and (ii) 
cg06633438 in MLLT1, statistically hypermethylated in cases (MD = 0.07, 95% CI = 
0.04|0.10, p = 1.0 × 10-6). Based on the interaction analysis, asbestos exposure 
and epigenetic profile together may improve MPM risk assessment. Above-median 
asbestos exposure and hypomethylation of cg03546163 in FKBP5 (OR = 20.84, 95% CI 
= 8.71|53.96, p = 5.5 × 10-11) and hypermethylation of cg06633438 in MLLT1 (OR = 
11.71, 95% CI = 4.97|29.64, p = 5.9 × 10-8) genes compared to below-median 
asbestos exposure and hyper/hypomethylation of single-CpG DNAm, respectively. 
Receiver Operation Characteristics (ROC) for Case-Control Discrimination showed 
a significant increase in MPM discrimination when DNAm information was added in 
the model (baseline model, BM: asbestos exposure, age, gender and white blood 
cells); area under the curve, AUC = 0.75; BM + cg03546163 at FKBP5. AUC = 0.89, 
2.1 × 10-7; BM + cg06633438 at MLLT1. AUC = 0.89, 6.3 × 10-8. Validation and 
replication procedures, considering independent sample size and a different DNAm 
analysis technique, confirmed the observed associations. Our results suggest the 
potential application of DNAm profiles in blood to develop noninvasive tests for 
MPM risk assessment in asbestos-exposed subjects.

Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is an emerging technique in the field of 
biomedical imaging, with applications in ophthalmology, dermatology, coronary 
imaging etc. OCT images usually suffer from a granular pattern, called speckle 
noise, which restricts the process of interpretation. Therefore the need for 
speckle noise reduction techniques is of high importance. To the best of our 
knowledge, use of Independent Component Analysis (ICA) techniques has never been 
explored for speckle reduction of OCT images. Here, a comparative study of 
several ICA techniques (InfoMax, JADE, FastICA and SOBI) is provided for noise 
reduction of retinal OCT images. Having multiple B-scans of the same location, 
the eye movements are compensated using a rigid registration technique. Then, 
different ICA techniques are applied to the aggregated set of B-scans for 
extracting the noise-free image. Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (SNR), 
Contrast-to-Noise-Ratio (CNR) and Equivalent-Number-of-Looks (ENL), as well as 
analysis on the computational complexity of the methods, are considered as 
metrics for comparison. The results show that use of ICA can be beneficial, 
especially in case of having fewer number of B-scans.

OBJECTIVES: 1. To study and compare the clinical and histological features of 
Type 1 and Type 2 lepra reactions. 2. To document the histological patterns of 
Type 1 and Type 2 lepra reactions observed in the study population.
DESIGN: Two year cross sectional study. Patients attending the outpatient 
department of our tertiary care hospital, during the 2 year study period with 
clinical evidence of Type 1 (T1R) or Type 2 (T2R) lepra reactions were included 
in this study after obtaining written informed consent. During this period 34 
T1R patients and 14 T2R patients attended our hospital. Biopsies were taken from 
reacting skin lesions of all patients and histological features were studied.
RESULTS: Dermal or intragranuloma oedema was evident in 50% of T1R patients and 
all of them had clinically severe reactions. The T1R patients showed three 
different histological patterns--pgrading reactions, downgrading reactions and 
reactions without upgrading or downgrading. Among T2R patients 8/14 showed 
neutrophil infiltration histologically, 5/14 showed no histological evidence of 
neutrophil infiltration and only one patient had features of neutrphilic 
vasculitis. Dermal oedema was seen in 11/14 cases.
CONCLUSIONS: Histology revealing dermal or intragranuloma oedema on a background 
of leprosy granuloma favours the diagnosis of lepra reaction. A careful analysis 
of subtle variations in the cells constituting the granuloma may aid in 
differentiating between upgrading T1R, downgrading T1R or T1R without upgrading 
or downgrading. Histology can also be useful in distinguishing T2R from T1R, in 
the absence of typical erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) lesions. Neutrophils are 
the major inflammatory cells in the former where as lymphocytes or macrophages 
predominate in the latter. We recommend that histopathological analysis should 
form an integral part of the evaluation of all lepra reactions.

Optical Coherence Tomography(OCT) gradually becomes a very important imaging 
technology in the Biomedical field for its noninvasive, nondestructive and 
real-time properties. However, the interpretation and application of the OCT 
images are limited by the ubiquitous noise. In this paper, a denoising algorithm 
based on contourlet transform for the OCT heart tube image is proposed. A 
bivariate function is constructed to model the joint probability density 
function (pdf) of the coefficient and its cousin in contourlet domain. A 
bivariate shrinkage function is deduced to denoise the image by the maximum a 
posteriori (MAP) estimation. Three metrics, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), 
contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and equivalent number of look (ENL), are used to 
evaluate the denoised image using the proposed algorithm. The results show that 
the signal-to-noise ratio is improved while the edges of object are preserved by 
the proposed algorithm. Systemic comparisons with other conventional algorithms, 
such as mean filter, median filter, RKT filter, Lee filter, as well as bivariate 
shrinkage function for wavelet-based algorithm are conducted. The advantage of 
the proposed algorithm over these methods is illustrated.

Janeiro, Brazil. esampaio@gene.dbbm.fiocruz.br

Thalidomide is being successfully used for the treatment of erythema nodosum 
leprosum (ENL), among other disorders with inflammatory and immunological bases. 
Although the active molecules responsible for the diverse therapeutic activities 
of the drug and the sequence of reactions triggered inside the cells remain 
unclear, it was demonstrated that thalidomide (THAL) inhibits TNFalpha mRNA 
expression and protein production by stimulated monocytes and activated T 
lymphocytes. Patients treated with THAL experienced a reduction in serum 
TNFalpha levels and it diminished cytokine gene expression at the lesion site, 
with a concomitant abrogation of clinical symptoms. It has been reported that 
thalidomide as well as some its analogues decrease M. leprae-induced TNFalpha 
and IL-12 mRNA in vitro. THAL also reduced monocyte apoptosis in the cultures. 
The present data further support thalidomide's effects on TNFa synthesis and the 
growing need to search for new specific TNFalpha inhibitors (non-teratogenic 
compounds) that might be potentially used in clinical disorders such as leprosy.

Dietary phytoestrogens, such as the lignan metabolite enterolactone (ENL) and 
the isoflavone genistein (GEN), are suggested to modulate the risk of 
estrogen-dependent disease (e.g., breast cancer) through regulation of estrogen 
signaling. However, the effects of complex food items containing lignans or 
isoflavones on estrogen receptor (ER) transactivation have not been assessed so 
far. In this study, the modulation of ER-mediated signaling by dietary sources 
of lignans (cereals and flaxseed) and isoflavones (soy) was studied in vivo. 
Adult ovariectomized 3 x ERE-luciferase (luc) reporter mice received isocaloric 
diets supplemented with flaxseed, rye, wheat, or soy for 40 h or two weeks, and 
an additional group of mice was challenged with 17beta-estradiol (E(2)) 
following the two-week dietary intervention. In non-E(2)-treated mice, soy diet 
induced luc expression in liver, mammary gland, and pituitary gland while the 
other diets had no effects. Interestingly, all diets modulated the E(2)-induced 
luc expression. In particular rye diet efficiently reduced E(2)-induced luc 
expression as well as uterine growth, the hallmark of estrogen action in vivo. 
It is concluded that dietary sources of lignans and isoflavones can modulate 
estrogen signaling in vivo. The results suggest intriguing possibilities for the 
modulation of the risk of estrogen-dependent diseases by dietary means.

Leprosy, Taj Ganj, Agra, U.P., India-282001. biostat@sancharnet.in

The bacteriological index (BI) of the skin smears is traditionally one of the 
important parameters of assessment of severity and of progress of leprosy under 
multidrug therapy. The present study reports on BI clearance among 578 
multibacillary treated leprosy patients and the factors that influence this 
clearance. The patients were treated till smear negativity or for 2 years fixed 
duration and their skin smears periodically examined every 6 to 12 months till 
negativity (and even afterwards). We confirm that bacterial clearance is a slow 
process. The time taken for each log-unit decline in BI is between 13.6 to 24 
months probably depending on initial BI level. The rate of smear negativity 
appears to be dependent on immune competence of the patients as reflected by a 
rapid BI decline in borderline BT-BB patients vis-à-vis BL-LL lepromatous 
patients both in the low and high BI group. Patients who had several episodes of 
ENL, took significantly longer time (63.7 months versus 53.5 months, p<0.0001) 
to become smear negative than those without ENL.

A follow up of T-cell subsets and of anti-M. leprae antibody titer as measured 
by the FLA-ABS test in Melanesian leprosy patients under polychemotherapy.

Garraud O, Ribierre O, Bach MA.

Melanesian leprosy patients from New Caledonia were studied for the following 
parameters during the course of polychemotherapy: peripheral blood T-cell 
subsets, as identified in an immunofluorescence assay with monoclonal antibodies 
OKT3 ("pan-T"), OKT4 ("helper/inducer"), and OKT8 ("cytotoxic-suppressor"), and 
anti-Mycobacterium leprae antibodies in the serum, as measured by the 
fluorescent leprosy antibody absorption test. A group of Melanesian healthy 
subjects with no known exposure to M. leprae served as controls. Healthy 
contacts of leprosy patients were also studied for the presence of anti-M. 
leprae antibodies. Untreated, nonreactional lepromatous patients displayed 
moderate but significant T-cell abnormalities, consisting of a decrease in the 
percentage of OKT3+ and OKT4+ cells with a decrease in the OKT4:OKT8 ratio. 
These abnormalities disappeared within nine months of treatment. A transient 
decrease in the percentage of OKT8+ cells with an increase in the OKT4:OKT8 
ratio was seen in patients suffering erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL). 
Tuberculoid patients, whether treated or not, did not show any T-cell marker 
disturbances. Positive serological tests for anti-M. leprae antibodies were 
found in 100% of lepromatous patients, 92% of tuberculoid patients, and 56% of 
healthy contacts. No significant decline in the antibody titer was observed with

Type 2 reaction (T2R) or erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL), a sudden episode of 
acute inflammation predominantly affecting lepromatous leprosy patients (LL), 
characterized by a reduced cellular immune response. This possibly indicates a 
close relationship between the onset of T2R and the altered frequency, and 
functional activity of T lymphocytes, particularly of memory subsets. This study 
performed ex vivo and in vitro characterizations of T cell blood subpopulations 
from LL patients with or without T2R. In addition, the evaluation of activity of 
these subpopulations was performed by analyzing the frequency of these cells 
producing IFN-γ, TNF, and IL-10 by flow cytometry. Furthermore, the expression 
of transcription factors, for the differentiation of T cells, were analyzed by 
quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Our results showed an 
increased frequency of CD8+/TNF+ effector memory T cells (TEM) among T2Rs. 
Moreover, there was evidence of a reduced frequency of CD4 and CD8+ 
IFN-γ-producing cells in T2R, and a reduced expression of STAT4 and TBX21. 
Finally, a significant and positive correlation between bacteriological index 
(BI) of T2R patients and CD4+/TNF+ and CD4+/IFN-γ+ T cells was observed. Thus, 
negative correlation between BI and the frequency of CD4+/IL-10+ T cells was 
noted. These results suggest that CD8+/TNF+ TEM are primarily responsible for 
the transient alteration in the immune response to Mycobacterium leprae in ENL 
patients. Thus, our study improves our understanding of pathogenic mechanisms 
and might suggest new therapeutic approaches for leprosy.

The disease leprosy is caused by Mycobacterium leprae. The disease displays a 
spectrum of clinical manifestations relating to the stage of the infection and 
the pathogen-specific immune response. The most frequent M. leprae-specific 
hypersensitivity reactions are erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) and type-1 
(reversal) reaction (T1R). Omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acid-derived lipid 
mediators are involved in the regulation of these M. leprae-specific 
inflammatory and immune responses. Studies on lipid mediators showed their 
presence during different manifestations of leprosy-before and after multidrug 
therapy (MDT) and during T1R. This review aims to compare the lipid mediators at 
different stages of the disease. This review also presents new data on the 
significance of lipid mediators (cysteinyl leukotrienes and leukotriene B4, 
prostaglandin E2 and D2, lipoxin A4 and resolvin D1) on ENL.

INTRODUCTION: MLL-rearranged acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in infants (<1 
year) is characterized by high relapse rates and a dismal prognosis. To 
facilitate the discovery of novel therapeutic targets, we here searched for 
genes directly influenced by the repression of various MLL fusions.
METHODS: For this, we performed gene expression profiling after siRNA-mediated 
repression of MLL-AF4, MLL-ENL, and AF4-MLL in MLL-rearranged ALL cell line 
models. The obtained results were compared with various already established gene 
signatures including those consisting of known MLL-AF4 target genes, or those 
associated with primary MLL-rearranged infant ALL samples.
RESULTS: Genes that were down-regulated in response to the repression of MLL-AF4 
and MLL-ENL appeared characteristically expressed in primary MLL-rearranged 
infant ALL samples, and often represented known MLL-AF4 targets genes. Genes 
that were up-regulated in response to the repression of MLL-AF4 and MLL-ENL 
often represented genes typically silenced by promoter hypermethylation in 
MLL-rearranged infant ALL. Genes that were affected in response to the 
repression of AF4-MLL showed significant enrichment in gene expression profiles 
associated with AF4-MLL expressing t(4;11)+ infant ALL patient samples.
CONCLUSION: We conclude that the here identified genes readily responsive to the 
loss of MLL fusion expression potentially represent attractive therapeutic 
targets and may provide additional insights in MLL-rearranged acute leukemias.

India.

A study was conducted to assess the response of reactions in leprosy to 
pentoxifylline therapy. Ten cases were studied; 8 cases had type 2 reaction and 
2 cases had type 1 reaction. Pentoxifylline was given orally 400 mg three times 
daily. In patients with type 2 reaction, good response was observed within one 
week. There was near complete regression of ENL lesions within one month. Cases 
with type 1 reaction did not respond to pentoxifylline.

Kanazawa Sutra (KanS) is a medicinal thread that is used for the treatment of 
anal fistula. It is used as a substitute for Kshara Sutra (KS) which is used in 
Ayurvedic medicine. KanS is composed of Ficus carica latex (FCL), Capsicum 
annuum tincture (CAT), Achyranthes fauriei Kshara (which is processed ash from 
the whole plant) and powdered Curcuma longa rhizome (CLR). In this study, we 
evaluated the ingredients of KanS by measuring nitric oxide (NO) production in 
murine macrophage-like cell line J774.1 as well as examining cytotoxicity to rat 
skeletal muscle myoblasts (L6) and L6 differentiation, with a view to improving 
its pharmacological effect. We focused on Mallotus japonicus bark (MJB), which 
is described in the Japanese Pharmacopeia and belongs to the Euphorbiaceae 
family. Its biological activities were evaluated in a similar manner to the 
evaluation of KanS ingredients. We found that MJB extracts showed similar 
biological activity to Euphorbia neriifolia latex (ENL), an ingredient of KS. We 
conclude that the NO inhibitory activity of KanS is mainly due to CLR, and its 
cytotoxicity to L6 and inhibitory activity on L6 differentiation are mainly due 
to CLR and FCL. As CAT has no characteristic activity, the biological activity 
and the anal fistula treatment ability of KanS would be improved by substituting 
MJB for CAT.

Multi-penalty conditional random field approach to super-resolved reconstruction 
of optical coherence tomography images.

Improving the spatial resolution of Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) images is 
important for the visualization and analysis of small morphological features in 
biological tissue such as blood vessels, membranes, cellular layers, etc. In 
this paper, we propose a novel reconstruction approach to obtaining 
super-resolved OCT tomograms from multiple lower resolution images. The proposed 
Multi-Penalty Conditional Random Field (MPCRF) method combines four different 
penalty factors (spatial proximity, first and second order intensity variations, 
as well as a spline-based smoothness of fit) into the prior model within a 
Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation framework. Test carried out in retinal OCT 
images illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed MPCRF reconstruction 
approach in terms of spatial resolution enhancement, as compared to previously 
published super resolved image reconstruction methods. Visual assessment of the 
MPCRF results demonstrate the potential of this method in better preservation of 
fine details and structures of the imaged sample, as well as retaining the 
sharpness of biological tissue boundaries while reducing the effects of speckle 
noise inherent to OCT. Quantitative evaluation using imaging metrics such as 
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), Contrast to Noise Ratio (CNR), Equivalent Number of 
Looks (ENL), and Edge Preservation Parameter show significant visual quality 
improvement with the MPCRF approach. Therefore, the proposed MPCRF 
reconstruction approach is an effective tool for enhancing the spatial 
resolution of OCT images without the necessity for significant imaging hardware 
modifications.

tomography retinal imagery.

An important image post-processing step for optical coherence tomography (OCT) 
images is speckle noise reduction. Noise in OCT images is multiplicative in 
nature and is difficult to suppress due to the fact that in addition the noise 
component, OCT speckle also carries structural information about the imaged 
object. To address this issue, a novel speckle noise reduction algorithm was 
developed. The algorithm projects the imaging data into the logarithmic space 
and a general Bayesian least squares estimate of the noise-free data is found 
using a conditional posterior sampling approach. The proposed algorithm was 
tested on a number of rodent (rat) retina images acquired in-vivo with an 
ultrahigh resolution OCT system. The performance of the algorithm was compared 
to that of the state-of-the-art algorithms currently available for speckle 
denoising, such as the adaptive median, maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation, 
linear least squares estimation, anisotropic diffusion and wavelet-domain 
filtering methods. Experimental results show that the proposed approach is 
capable of achieving state-of-the-art performance when compared to the other 
tested methods in terms of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), contrast-to-noise ratio 
(CNR), edge preservation, and equivalent number of looks (ENL) measures. Visual 
comparisons also show that the proposed approach provides effective speckle 
noise suppression while preserving the sharpness and improving the visibility of 
morphological details, such as tiny capillaries and thin layers in the rat 
retina OCT images.

Comparative effects of the metabolic inhibitors 2,4-dinitrophenol and 
iodoacetate on mouse neuroblastoma cells in vitro.

Andrés MI(1), Repetto G, Sanz P, Repetto M.

Author information:
(1)National Institute of Toxicology, Seville, Spain.

The toxic effects of two metabolic inhibitors, dinitrophenol and iodoacetic 
acid, were compared. Mouse neuroblastoma cell cultures (Neuro-2a) were exposed 
to different concentrations of the toxic compounds for 24, 48 and 72 h to study 
basal toxicity effects (cell proliferation by quantification of total protein 
content (PR) and relative neutral red uptake (RNRU) by lysosomes). The following 
biochemical indicators assessed in the in vitro test system were: cytosolic 
phosphofructokinase (PFK) and enolase (ENL) activities in glycolysis; 
mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activity in the citric acid cycle; 
lysosomal beta-galactosidase (GAL) activity; and neuronal acetylcholinesterase 
(AChE) activity. The effects of the two metabolic inhibitors on the various 
indicators differed. Iodoacetic acid was found to be far more toxic than 
dinitrophenol to neuroblastoma cell proliferation at 24 h exposure. Though 
2,4-dinitrophenol and iodoacetic acid both inhibited cell proliferation of the 
neuroblastoma cells, their effects on the other endpoints were opposite. 
Dinitrophenol was a general activator of the metabolism, particularly affecting 
lysosomal function. Iodoacetic acid did not significantly alter general 
metabolism, but considerably modified lysosomal function and AChE activity. The 
modification of lysosomal function of Neuro-2a cells by the two compounds was 
quite different: dinitrophenol increased RNRU and GAL activity, and iodoacetic 
acid decreased both parameters.

Autoantibodies to cerebroside sulphate (sulphatide) in leprosy.

Medicine, UK.

Sera from 40 leprosy patients were screened for autoantibodies to cerebroside 
sulphate (sulphatide). Anti-sulphatide IgM in groups of patients with 
lepromatous (LL) and borderline (BL + BB + BT), but not with tuberculoid (TT) 
disease, were significantly elevated above the levels found in endemic control 
subjects. Eight-six percent (18 out of 21; mean 1.59 OD units) of LL, 33% (four 
out of 12; mean 1.08 OD units) of borderline and 13% (one out of eight; mean 
0.69 OD units) of tuberculoid patients had anti-sulphatide IgM in their sera 
above a cut-off value of 2 s.d. above the mean value (0.66 OD units) for control 
sera. Elevated anti-sulphatide IgG was detected in only one patient's serum, an 
individual with LL disease. The level of anti-sulphatide IgM was strongly 
correlated to expression of the TH3 idiotype, an idiotype previously defined by 
a human MoAb that bound Mycobacterium leprae phenolic glycolipid, Klebsiella 
capsular polysaccharide, polynucleotides and human tissues. The purified, TH3 
MoAb was found in this study to bind sulphatide, but not cholesterol-3-sulphate 
or cerebroside. It is suggested that anti-sulphatide IgM is elevated in leprosy, 
in relation to the bacterial load. Anti-sulphatide IgM fell at the onset of 
erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) reaction, consistent with the deposition of 
serum antibodies, and thus may play a part in pathology during periods of 
inflammation, particularly in multibacillary patients.

Hospital, New Delhi, India.

BACKGROUND: Leprosy relapse/recurrence is a serious concern particularly in a 
leprosy-endemic nation such as India. It is believed that bacilli persisting 
even after multidrug therapy can cause relapse; recently, however, drug 
resistance as a cause for recurrences and chronic erythema nodosum leprosum 
(ENL) has been speculated.
AIM: To study drug-resistance patterns in cases of leprosy relapse and 
chronic/recurrent (c/r)ENL.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study conducted over a period of 1 year included 
patients diagnosed as having leprosy relapse and those with c/rENL. Skin biopsy 
specimens were examined by conventional PCR for resistance testing for 
rifampicin, dapsone and ofloxacin, respectively targeting the rpoB, folP and 
gyrA genes of Mycobacterium leprae.
RESULTS: In total, 61 patients (25 smear-negative) were included in the study. 
Of these, 37 were diagnosed as having leprosy relapse and 24 as having c/rENL. 
Drug resistance to at least one drug was identified in 10 cases (16.4%). Rates 
of drug resistance were 5.4% (2 of 37) for dapsone, 10.8% (4 of 37) for 
rifampicin and 2.7% (1 of 37) for ofloxacin among cases of relapse, whereas it 
was 12.5% (3 of 24) and 8.3% (2 of 24) for dapsone and rifampicin respectively 
among those with c/rENL. Multidrug resistance was seen in 3.3% patients (2 of 
61).
CONCLUSION: Drug-resistance rate among those with c/rENL was almost equalled 
that of relapse. Smear-negative leprosy relapse cases also had resistance to 
bactericidal drugs. These findings call for modifications in criteria for 
testing under leprosy drug-resistance surveillance and all cases of relapse and 
those with recalcitrant c/rENL should be tested.

SCOPE: Phytoestrogens (PE) may improve breast cancer prognosis by modifying 
tumor prognostic markers, such as cell proliferation marker Ki-67 and human 
epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). Epidemiological evidence linking 
lignans and isoflavones to Ki-67 and HER2 is limited. We examined associations 
between the major metabolites of lignans and isoflavones - enterolactone (ENL) 
and genistein (GEN) - respectively, and Ki-67 expression and HER2 in tumor 
tissue of breast cancer patients.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Data from 1060 invasive breast cancer patients from the 
population-based MARIE study were used. Multivariate-adjusted linear (Ki-67 
log-transformed) and quantile regression, and logistic regression analyses 
(HER2, Ki-67 dichotomized) were performed to calculate β estimates and ORs, 
respectively. Median post-diagnostic ENL and GEN concentrations were 19.5 and 
4.8 nmol/L, respectively. Median Ki-67 was 12.0%, and 21.2% of the tumors were 
HER2+. After adjustment, there was an inverse association between GEN and Ki-67 
at high expression levels (OR for Ki-67 ≥20% versus <20% of 0.93 (95%CI 
[0.87;0.99]) per 10 nmol/L GEN increment).
CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate an inverse association between GEN and Ki-67 
at high levels of Ki-67 expression. Additional investigations are recommended to 
confirm our findings and to further elucidate mechanisms linking PE metabolites 
to breast cancer survival.

Lignans have long been known for their abundant therapeutic properties due to 
their polyphenolic structure. Linseed is the richest plant source of lignans and 
has been studied widely for their properties. The most prevalent lignan, 
secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG), is consumed with linseed and converted 
into mammalian lignans, enterodiol (END) and enterolactone (ENL), by the gut 
microbiota. SDG can easily be assessed using HPLC and its deglycosylated form 
viz secoisolariciresinol can be asses using GC-MS techniques. Variety of 
extraction and analysis methods has been reported for plant lignans. SDG is 
known to have therapeutic properties including anti-oxidant, anti-cancerous, 
anti-inflammatory, modulation of gene expression, anti-diabetic, estrogenic and 
anti-estrogenic. Despite a large number of bioactivities, strong evidences for 
the underlying mechanisms for most of the properties are still unknown. SDG is 
most studied for its anti-cancerous properties. But the use of lignans as 
anti-carcinogenic agent is limited and commercially not reported due to 
challenges of purification at commercial level, rapid metabolism, untargeted 
delivery and toxic compounds associated with lignans. Exploration of more 
prominent and active derivatives of SDG and their targeted drug delivery should 
be an important research toward the use of bioactive lignans of linseed.

Mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) fusions are transcriptional activators that induce 
leukemia, with a dismal prognosis that mandates further elucidation of their 
transformation mechanism. In this study, knockdown of the direct MLL-ENL target 
gene polypyrimidine tract binding protein-1 (PTBP1) was rate limiting for cell 
proliferation and caused a metabolic phenotype associated with reduced glucose 
consumption and lactate production. This effect was accompanied by a reduction 
of splice isoform-2 of pyruvate kinase M (PKM2). Because PKM2 restricts 
glycolytic outflow to provide anabolic intermediates, we tested the consequences 
of glucose, energy, and Ser/Gly starvation for cell physiology. Administration 
of deoxyglucose, energetic decoupling with rotenone, and inhibition of Ser 
biosynthesis by CBR5884 had a significantly stronger influence on self-renewal 
and survival of transformed cells than on normal controls. In particular, 
inhibition of Ser synthesis, which branches off glycolysis caused accumulation 
of reactive oxygen species, DNA damage, and apoptosis, predominantly in leukemic 
cells. Depletion of exogenous Ser/Gly affected proliferation and self-renewal of 
murine and human leukemia samples, even though they are classified as 
nonessential amino acids. Response to Ser/Gly starvation correlated with glucose 
transport, but did not involve activation of the AMPK energy homeostasis system. 
Finally, survival times in transplantation experiments were significantly 
extended by feeding recipients a Ser/Gly-free diet. These results suggest 
selective starvation as an option for supportive leukemia treatment.

TlyA protein of Mycobacterium leprae: a probable bio-marker of active infection.

Deval H, Katoch K, Chauhan DS, Tyagi AK, Gupta RK, Kamal R, Kumar A, Yadav VS, 
Katoch VM, Hussain T.

The extent of pathogenicity of the mycobacterial infections depends on virulence 
factors that mediate survival inside macrophages. Virulence factors are 
generally believed to be specific for pathogenic species and 
mutated/non-functional in nonpathogenic strains. Mycobacterial TlyA can modulate 
the phagolysosome maturation pathway, immediately after entry into macrophages. 
Over-expression of open reading frame (ORF) ML1358 (tlyA) in tissues of leprosy 
patients by partial DNA chip and real time PCR analysis during active infection 
attracted our interest to explore the properties of this gene at molecular and 
serological levels, to understand its role in the host. Molecular properties 
were studied by cloning and expression of the corresponding gene in pASK-iba 
43(þ) expression vector in E. coli and bioinformatics tools while sodium dodecyl 
sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and ELISA were applied to 
investigate the serological significance of rTlyA protein in different clinical 
states of leprosy. We observed that TlyA has a close relation among mycobacteria 
with specific protein domains in slow growing intracellular adapted pathogenic 
species. The presence of trans-membrane domains indicates its association to the 
cell membrane. The study revealed its highly significant sero-reactivity (P 
value , 0·001) in borderline lepromatous (BL) patients, and those with reversal 
reaction (RR) and erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL). Its role in active infection, 
association with the cell membrane, presence in pathogenic species and high 
sero-reactivity, suggested the tlyA gene as a strong disease progression marker.

Comment in
    Leuk Lymphoma. 2013 May;54(5):901-2.

This study aimed to analyze the distribution of lymphoid neoplasms in a single 
tertiary care center in India using the World Health Organization (WHO) 2008 
classification. Histological material of 5115 patients with histopathological 
diagnosis of lymphoma, diagnosed over a period of 10 years (2001-2010), was 
analyzed retrospectively. Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) constituted 21.3% (n = 1089) and 
non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs) constituted 78.7% (n = 4026). Of these, B-cell 
neoplasms accounted for 78.6% (n = 3166) and T-cell/natural killer (NK)-cell 
neoplasms 20.2% (n = 815) of the NHLs. The commonest subtype of NHL was diffuse 
large B-cell lymphoma (n = 1886, 46.9%). The frequency of peripheral 
T-cell/NK-cell lymphomas in this study was higher than in the Western literature 
but less than the frequency documented in some Asian countries. Similar to the 
Western literature but in contrast to previous Indian studies, peripheral T-cell 
lymphoma, not otherwise specified (PTCL NOS) (n = 238) was the commonest 
histological subtype of T-cell/NK-cell NHL in this study and constituted 5.9% of 
the total NHLs. Mixed cellularity (MC-CHL) (n = 488, 45%) was the major subtype 
of HL. Primary extranodal lymphoma (ENL) accounted for 32.8% (n = 1321) of all 
NHLs and most frequently involved the gastrointestinal tract. This study also 
documents the frequency of many rare types of lymphoma in South India.

Class specific anti-Mycobacterium leprae antibody assay in lepromatous leprosy 
(BL-LL) patients during the first two to four years of DDS treatment.

Melsom R, Harboe M, Naafs B.

Previously, a slight decrease in antibodies against M. leprae antigen 7 was 
demonstrated after one year of dapsone (DDS) treatment in 14 of 15 patients with 
lepromatous (BL-LL) leprosy. The same patients have now received DDS from 11/2 
to 4 years (median 3 years) and sera taken at the start, during, and at the end 
of the observation period have been retested for antibodies against M. leprae 
antigen 7 by radioimmunoassay and tested for IgA-, IgM-, and IgG-anti-M. leprae 
antibody activity by solid phase radioimmunoassay. Both IgA- and IgG-anti-M. 
leprae antibody activity and the activity of antibodies against M. leprae 
antigen 7 showed a decrease in activity after three years of DDS treatment to a 
median value of about one third of the activity in the sera taken at the start 
of the study. A smaller but significant decrease in IgM-anti-M. leprae antibody 
activity could be demonstrated. A transient increase in antibody activity (both 
measured by RIA and sRIA) could be demonstrated and related to reactions 
(reversal reaction and ENL) in five patients. No significant correlation could 
be found when IgA-, IgM-, and IgG-anti-M. leprae antibody activity was compared 
with antibodies against M. Leprae antigen 7 in individual sera.

We present a technique to reduce speckle in visible-light optical coherence 
tomography (vis-OCT) that preserves fine structural details and is robust 
against sample motion. Specifically, we locally modulate B-scans orthogonally to 
their axis of acquisition. Such modulation enables acquisition of uncorrelated 
speckle patterns from similar anatomical locations, which can be averaged to 
reduce speckle. To verify the effectiveness of speckle reduction, we performed 
in-vivo retinal imaging using modulated raster and circular scans in both mice 
and humans. We compared speckle-reduced vis-OCT images with the images acquired 
with unmodulated B-scans from the same anatomical locations. We compared 
contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and equivalent number of looks (ENL) to quantify 
the image quality enhancement. Speckle-reduced images showed up to a 2.35-dB 
improvement in CNR and up to a 3.1-fold improvement in ENL with more discernable 
anatomical features using eight modulated A-line averages at a 25-kHz A-line 
rate.

The effect of 6 months of treatment with indapamide (IND, 2.5 mg/day) on 
regression of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), an independent predictor of 
poor prognosis in hypertension, was compared by echocardiography to that of 
nifedipine (NFD, 40 mg/day), enalapril (ENL, 20 mg/day), atenolol (ATL, 100 
mg/day), and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ, 25 mg/day) in four parallel double-blind 
studies in 151 hypertensive patients with a diastolic blood pressure between 95 
and 120 mm Hg and a raised left ventricular mass index (LVMI) (mg/m2) 
(Devereux). Patients were randomized to IND or comparator following a 2-week 
washout (1 month in the IND vs. ATL study). Respective baseline and 6-month LVMI 
values (mg/m2) were: IND (n = 20) vs. HCTZ (n = 20): 151.4 +/- 6.3 and 125.70 
+/- 4.6 (p < 0.001) vs. 141.3 +/- 6.6 and 135.6 +/- 8.3 (p = N.S.); IND (n = 22) 
vs NFD (n = 19): 144.1 +/- 5.3 and 125.1 +/- 4.3 (p < 0.001) vs. 170.4 +/- 6.6 
and 148.2 +/- 6.2 (p < 0.001); IND (n = 9) vs. ENL (n = 9): 155.1 +/- 6.3 and 
143.4 +/- 5.2 (p < 0.001) vs. 142.0 +/- 6.7 and 130.0 +/- 5.9 (p < 0.001); IND 
(n = 17) vs. ATL (n = 12): 146.2 +/- 5.1 and 130.8 +/- 6.5 (p < 0.001) vs. 156.7 
+/- 8.4 and 142.9 +/- 10.3 (p < 0.01). All drugs significantly reduced diastolic 
blood pressure, and all except HCTZ induced a significant and similar reduction 
in left ventricular mass.

Serum proteins and plasma fibrinogen were estimated in 103 patients in various 
groups of leprosy and 52 patients of reactional leprosy. Total proteins, serum 
globulin and fibrinogen showed significant rise while serum albumin showed fall 
over the immunological spectrum from TT to LL. Type II reactional leprosy 
similarly revealed significant rise in globulin and fibrinogen. The comparison 
of these parameters between most of the comparable groups of leprosy was 
statistically significant. ENL patients after complete subsidence of reaction 
and after steroid treatment showed significant decrease in these protein 
fractions, thus conferring some prognostic implication on these tests.

Translocation of the mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) gene with AF4, AF9, or ENL 
results in acute leukemia with both lymphoid and myeloid involvement. We 
characterized leukemia-initiating cells (LICs) in primary infant MLL-rearranged 
leukemia using a xenotransplantation model. In MLL-AF4 patients, 
CD34(+)CD38(+)CD19(+) and CD34(-)CD19(+) cells initiated leukemia, and in 
MLL-AF9 patients, CD34(-)CD19(+) cells were LICs. In MLL-ENL patients, either 
CD34(+) or CD34(-) cells were LICs, depending on the pattern of CD34 expression. 
In contrast, in patients with these MLL translocations, 
CD34(+)CD38(-)CD19(-)CD33(-) cells were enriched for normal hematopoietic stem 
cells (HSCs) with in vivo long-term multilineage hematopoietic repopulation 
capacity. Although LICs developed leukemic cells with clonal immunoglobulin 
heavy-chain (IGH) rearrangement in vivo, CD34(+)CD38(-)CD19(-)CD33(-) cells 
repopulated recipient bone marrow and spleen with B cells, showing broad 
polyclonal IGH rearrangement and recipient thymus with CD4(+) single positive 
(SP), CD8(+) SP, and CD4(+)CD8(+) double-positive (DP) T cells. Global gene 
expression profiling revealed that CD9, CD32, and CD24 were over-represented in 
MLL-AF4, MLL-AF9, and MLL-ENL LICs compared with normal HSCs. In patient 
samples, these molecules were expressed in CD34(+)CD38(+) and CD34(-) LICs but 
not in CD34(+)CD38(-)CD19(-)CD33(-) HSCs. Identification of LICs and 
LIC-specific molecules in primary human MLL-rearranged acute lymphoblastic 
leukemia may lead to improved therapeutic strategies for MLL-rearranged 
leukemia.

MLL is involved in fusion genes with more than 100 partner genes, approximately 
80 of which have been characterized at the molecular level. MLL fusion genes are 
often found in infants (60-80% of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cases and 
40-50% of acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) cases) and are appreciably rarer 
(8-10%) in children older than 1 year of age. MLL rearrangements are important 
markers in diagnosis and treatment choice. To identify the partner gene is of 
primary importance for prognosis and minimal residual disease monitoring. The 
structure of the fusion gene, including localization of the MLL breakpoints, is 
also informative. A method was developed to examine the fusion transcripts in 
order to identify the partner gene among the six most common ones and to 
establish the exon structure of the rearranged MLL. The method includes a 
multiplex reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to amplify 
and to fluorescently label a fusion transcript fragment and subsequent 
hybridization of the product on a biological microchip with immobilized 
oligonucleotides complementary to exons of MLL and its partner genes AFF1, 
MLLT1, MLLT3, MLLT4, MLLT10, and ELL. Hybridization results were verified by 
sequencing the RT-PCR products and, in some cases, performing long-distance 
inverse PCR (LDI-PCR). The study involved 38 bone marrow samples from ALL 
patients (including 33 children younger than 1 year of age) and 15 samples from 
AML patients (including 10 from children younger than 1 year of age). The main 
partner genes were AFF1 (49%), MLLT1 (27%), MLLT3 (12%), and MLLT10 (12%) in ALL 
and MLLT3 (80%), MLLT10 (10%), and MLLT4 (10%) in AML. Fusion gene transcripts 
most commonly included MLL exon 11 (58% of ALL cases and 50% of AML cases), 
suggesting a breakpoint in MLL intron 11.

INTRODUCTION: Pyranosides as one kind of natural glycosides contain a pyran ring 
linked to an aglycone in the structure. They occur widely in plants and possess 
diverse biological activities. The discovery of new pyranosides not only 
contributes to research on natural products but also may promote pharmaceutical 
development.
OBJECTIVES: A non-targeted liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass 
spectrometry method coupled with an all ion fragmentation-exact neutral loss 
(AIF-ENL) strategy was developed for the screening of pyranosides in plants.
METHODS: Pyranosides in various types were collected as a model. The AIF-ENL 
strategy comprised three steps: AIF spectrum acquisition and generation, 
ENL-based searching and identification, and confirmation of structural type 
using target second-stage mass spectrometry (MS/MS). The strategy was 
systematically evaluated based on the matrix effects, fragmentation stability, 
scan rate and screening efficiency and finally applied to Rhodiola crenulata 
(Hook. f. et Thoms) H. Ohba.
RESULTS: The method was proved to be an efficient tool for the screening of 
pyranosides. When it was applied to R. crenulata, a total of 24 pyranoside 
candidates were detected. Among them, six were tentatively identified on the 
basis of the agreement of their elemental composition with the reported. The 
other 18 were detected in R. crenulata for the first time.
CONCLUSION: The method offers a new platform for discovering pyranosides. In 
addition, the developed non-targeted strategy can also be used for other natural 
products, such as flavonoids and coumarins, as long as there is a common 
fragmentation behaviour in their MS/MS to generate characteristic neutral losses 
or fragments.

Survival of infants with KMT2A-rearranged (R) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) 
remains dismal despite intensive chemotherapy. We observed constitutive 
phosphorylation of spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) and associated signaling 
proteins in infant ALL patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model specimens and 
hypothesized that the SYK inhibitor entospletinib would inhibit signaling and 
cell growth in vitro and leukemia proliferation in vivo. We further predicted 
that combined entospletinib and chemotherapy could augment anti-leukemia 
effects. Basal kinase signaling activation and HOXA9/MEIS1 expression differed 
among KMT2A-R (KMT2A-AFF1 [n=4], KMT2A-MLLT3 [n=1], KMT2A-MLLT1 [n=4]) and 
non-KMT2A-R [n=3] ALL specimens and stratified by genetic subgroup. Incubation 
of KMT2A-R ALL cells in vitro with entospletinib inhibited methylcellulose 
colony formation and SYK pathway signaling in a dose-dependent manner. In vivo 
inhibition of leukemia proliferation with entospletinib monotherapy was observed 
in RAS-wild-type KMT2A-AFF1, KMT2A-MLLT3, and KMT2A-MLLT1 ALL PDX models with 
enhanced activity in combination with vincristine chemotherapy in several 
models. Surprisingly, entospletinib did not decrease leukemia burden in two 
KMT2A-AFF1 PDX models with NRAS/ or KRAS mutations, suggesting potential 
RAS-mediated resistance to SYK inhibition. As hypothesized, superior inhibition 
of ALL proliferation was observed in KMT2A-AFF1 PDX models treated with 
entospletinib and the MEK inhibitor selumetinib versus vehicle or inhibitor 
monotherapies (p.

Melampomagnolide B (MMB, 3) is a parthenolide (PTL, 1) based sesquiterpene 
lactone that has been used as a template for the synthesis of a plethora of lead 
anticancer agents owing to its reactive C-10 primary hydroxyl group. Such 
compounds have been shown to inhibit the IKKβ subunit, preventing 
phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic IκB inhibitory complex. The present study 
focuses on the synthesis and in vitro antitumor properties of novel benzyl and 
phenethyl carbamates of MMB (7a-7k). Screening of these MMB carbamates 
identified analogs with potent growth inhibition properties against a panel of 
60 human cancer cell lines (71% of the molecules screened had GI50 
values < 2 μM). Two analogs, the benzyl carbamate 7b and the phenethyl 
carbamate7k, were the most active compounds. Lead compound 7b inhibited cell 
proliferation in M9 ENL AML cells, and in TMD-231, OV-MD-231 and SUM149 breast 
cancer cell lines. Interestingly, mechanistic studies showed that 7b did not 
inhibit p65 phosphorylation in M9 ENL AML and OV-MD-231 cells, but did inhibit 
phophorylation of both p65 and IκBα in SUM149 cells. 7b also reduced NFκB 
binding to DNA in both OV-MD-231 and SUM149 cells. Molecular docking studies 
indicated that 7b and 7k are both predicted to interact with the ubiquitin-like 
domain (ULD) of the IKKβ subunit. These data suggest that in SUM149 cells, 7b is 
likely acting as an allosteric inhibitor of IKKβ, whereas in M9 ENL AML and 
OV-MD-231 cells 7b is able to inhibit an event after IκB/p65/p50 phosphorylation 
by IKKβ that leads to inhibition of NFκB activation and reduction in NFκB-DNA 
binding. Analog 7b was by far the most potent compound in either carbamate 
series, and was considered an important lead compound for further optimization 
and development as an anticancer agent.

A 28-year-old married female developed histoid papules and nodules de novo over 
her face, extremities, back, buttocks and thighs. She had developed erythema 
nodosum leprosum lesions without any antileprosy treatment. Histopathology from 
a histoid nodule showed well defined nodular collections of plump, 
spindle-shaped histiocytes. A few globi were also seen with Ziehl Neelson 
staining. Leucocytoclastic vasculitis was present in the ENL lesion. The CD4:CD8 
ratio was 1.5:1.

The study was designed for evaluating immunological reactivity to various 
mycobacterial protein preparations using serological and cell-mediated 
immunological tests in patients with clinical leprosy signs, predominantly, with 
the multibacillary forms. All patients were adults with ages between 20 and 30 
years. Fifty eight (n = 81) percent corresponded to Lepromatous Leprosy (LL), 
29% (n = 41) to Borderline Lepromatous Leprosy (BL) and 10% (n = 41) to 
Borderline Borderline Leprosy (BB); only 3% were Borderline Tuberculoid (BT) 
patients: 74% males and 26% females. The most frequent reactional phenomenon was 
of the Erythema Nodosum (ENL) type. The mycobacterial proteins tested were: 
total crude Mycobacterium leprae antigens (MISA); Mycobacterium bovis (MbSA and 
excretion MbSA); partially purified excretion protein antigen, with a 30 kDa 
relative movility (Ml30); and recombinant M. leprae proteins (Mt70, Mb 65, Ml 
36, 28, 18 and 10 kDa). Two of the recombinant proteins (Ml10 and Ml 36 kDa) 
presented a statiscally significant higher serological reactivity, directly 
related with a larger bacillary load (p = 0.0051 and 0.050 respectively). The 30 
kDa protein was predominantly recognized by antibodies from multibacillary 
patients. Results show that mean antibody values were higher in non reactional 
patients when tested against complete proteins (MbSA and ex MbSA) when compared 
with the group of patients who presented reactional phenomena (p = 0.000567 and 
0.000061, respectively). Comparing reactional with non reactional patients, it 
was seen that mean antibody values against complete proteins (MbSA and ex MbSA) 
were higher in non reactional individuals (p = 0.000567 and 0.000061, 
respectively). This same behavior occurred towards individual mycobacterial 
proteins (30, 10 and 36 kDa). The T lymphocyte prolypherative response in 
reactional and non reactional patients towards mycobacterial proteins (MlSA, Ml 
10 kDa, MbSA, ex MbSA) was negative.

Although thalidomide was withdrawn due to teratogenicity and neuropathy, there 
is now growing clinical interest in this compound because of its 
immunomodulatory and anti-angiogenic properties. In 1998, thalidomide was 
approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of erythema 
nodosum leprosum (ENL), an inflammatory complication of Hansen's disease, 
through a restricted-use program. Thalidomide was approved for the treatment of 
relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (MM) as an orphan drug in Japan. Direct 
deproteinization method was shown to be useful for quantitation of 
enantioselective thalidomide blood level. Stabilized blood was deproteinized 
with methanol and 2 M trichloroacetic acid. The supernatant was injected onto 
reverse-phase column (CHIRALPAK AD-RH). The mobile phase consisted of 10% 
acetonitrile, 70% methanol and 20% 0.025 m citrate buffer (pH 3.0), and the flow 
rate was 0.5 ml/min. Wavelength of detection was 220 nm. (-)-(S)-thalidomide and 
(+)-(R)-thalidomide were separated at 13.5 min and 17.6 min, respectively. The 
accuracy of this method was almost the same as that of the measurement technique 
with extraction and concentration. In clinical practice, MM patients usually 
take many kinds of drugs at the same time. Actually, this patient takes a lot of 
drugs with thalidomide. However, we found no interference of these drugs and 
thalidomide on the chromatogram. This simple and reliable HPLC determination 
method for both enantiomers of thalidomide is thought to be very useful for 
thalidomide studies.

In infantile leukemias and therapy-related leukemias, the MLL gene is frequently 
found to be disrupted and fused to various translocation partner genes, such as 
AF4/FEL, LTG9/AF9 and LTG19/ENL as a result of 11q23 translocations. We 
previously showed that the N-terminal portion common to various chimeric MLL 
products, as well as to MLL-LTG9 and MLL-LTG19, localizes in the nuclei, and 
therefore suggested that it might play an important role in leukemogenesis. In 
the present study, MLL-AF6 chimeric products found in the t(6;11)(q27;q23) 
translocation were analysed since AF6, a Ras-binding protein, exhibits a 
different subcellular localization from that of LTG9/AF9 and LTG19/ENL. 
Immunofluorescence staining data and cell fractionation analyses demonstrated 
that MLL-AF6 chimeric products localize in the nuclei despite the fact that AF6 
itself localizes in the cytoplasm, confirming the importance of the nuclear 
localization of chimeric MLL products. The region in the N-terminal portion of 
MLL responsible for this nuclear localization was examined and found to be a 
region containing AT-hook motifs.

BACKGROUND: Birthweight marks an important milestone of health across the 
lifespan, including cardiometabolic disease risk in later life. The placenta, a 
transient organ at the maternal-fetal interface, regulates fetal growth. 
Identifying genetic loci where DNA methylation in placenta is associated with 
birthweight can unravel genomic pathways that are dysregulated in aberrant fetal 
growth and cardiometabolic diseases in later life.
RESULTS: We performed placental epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of 
birthweight in an ethnic diverse cohort of pregnant women (n = 301). Methylation 
at 15 cytosine-(phosphate)-guanine sites (CpGs) was associated with birthweight 
(false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05). Methylation at four (26.7%) CpG sites was 
associated with placental transcript levels of 15 genes (FDR < 0.05), including 
genes known to be associated with adult lipid traits, inflammation and oxidative 
stress. Increased methylation at cg06155341 was associated with higher 
birthweight and lower FOSL1 expression, and lower FOSL1 expression was 
correlated with higher birthweight. Given the role of the FOSL1 transcription 
factor in regulating developmental processes at the maternal-fetal interface, 
epigenetic mechanisms at this locus may regulate fetal development. We 
demonstrated trans-tissue portability of methylation at four genes (MLLT1, 
PDE9A, ASAP2, and SLC20A2) implicated in birthweight by a previous study in cord 
blood. We also found that methylation changes known to be related to maternal 
underweight, preeclampsia and adult type 2 diabetes were associated with lower 
birthweight in placenta.
CONCLUSION: We identified novel placental DNA methylation changes associated 
with birthweight. Placental epigenetic mechanisms may underlie dysregulated 
fetal development and early origins of adult cardiometabolic diseases.

A survey on eye involvement among leprosy patients in The Netherlands.

Hogeweg M, Leiker DL.

A survey of 121 leprosy patients in the Netherlands showed eye involvement in 
20% of the patients, rising to 27% if madarosis and the adnexae are included. 
Iris atrophy was the main lesion encountered in BL and LL patients. One typical 
lepromatous fundus lesion was seen. No bilateral blindness occurred. Two eyes 
had a visual acuity of 3/60 due to intractable scleritis and acute iritis in LL 
with ENL. Seven eyes of 5 patients had a visual acuity of 0.2 to 3/60, mainly 
due to iris atrophy in lepromatous leprosy. Prevalence of blindness in our 
series was low as compared with the literature.

The nanotopography and nanoscale geometry of the extra-cellular matrix (ECM) are 
important regulators of cell adhesion, motility and fate decision. However, 
unlike the sensing of matrix mechanics and ECM density, the molecular processes 
regulating the direct sensing of the ECM nanotopography and nanoscale geometry 
are not well understood. Here, we use nanotopographical patterns generated via 
electrospun nanofibre lithography (ENL) to investigate the mechanisms of 
nanotopography sensing by cells. We observe the dysregulation of actin dynamics, 
resulting in the surprising formation of actin foci. This alteration of actin 
organisation is regulated by myosin contractility but independent of adapter 
proteins such as vinculin. This process is highly dependent on differential 
integrin expression as β3 integrin expressing cells, more sensitive to 
nanopattern dimensions than β1 integrin expressing cells, also display increased 
perturbation of actin assembly and actin foci formation. We propose that, in β3 
integrin expressing cells, contractility results in the destabilisation of 
nanopatterned actin networks, collapsing into foci and sequestering regulators 
of actin dynamics such as cofilin that orchestrate disassembly. Therefore, in 
contrast to the sensing of substrate mechanics and ECM ligand density, which are 
directly orchestrated by focal adhesion assembly, we propose that nanotopography 
sensing is regulated by a long-range sensing mechanism, remote from focal 
adhesions and mediated by the actin architecture.

RNA Polymerase II-Dependent Transcription Initiated by Selectivity Factor 1: A 
Central Mechanism Used by MLL Fusion Proteins in Leukemic Transformation.

Yokoyama A(1).

Author information:

Cancer cells transcribe RNAs in a characteristic manner in order to maintain 
their oncogenic potentials. In eukaryotes, RNA is polymerized by three distinct 
RNA polymerases, RNA polymerase I, II, and III (RNAP1, RNAP2, and RNAP3, 
respectively). The transcriptional machinery that initiates each transcription 
reaction has been purified and characterized. Selectivity factor 1 (SL1) is the 
complex responsible for RNAP1 pre-initiation complex formation. However, whether 
it plays any role in RNAP2-dependent transcription remains unclear. Our group 
previously found that SL1 specifically associates with AF4 family proteins. AF4 
family proteins form the AEP complex with ENL family proteins and the P-TEFb 
elongation factor. Similar complexes have been independently characterized by 
several different laboratories and are often referred to as super elongation 
complex. The involvement of AEP in RNAP2-dependent transcription indicates that 
SL1 must play an important role in RNAP2-dependent transcription. To date, this 
role of SL1 has not been appreciated. In leukemia, AF4 and ENL family genes are 
frequently rearranged to form chimeric fusion genes with MLL. The resultant MLL 
fusion genes produce chimeric MLL fusion proteins comprising MLL and AEP 
components. The MLL portion functions as a targeting module, which specifically 
binds chromatin containing di-/tri-methylated histone H3 lysine 36 and 
non-methylated CpGs. This type of chromatin is enriched at the promoters of 
transcriptionally active genes which allows MLL fusion proteins to selectively 
bind to transcriptionally-active/CpG-rich gene promoters. The fusion partner 
portion, which recruits other AEP components and SL1, is responsible for 
activation of RNAP2-dependent transcription. Consequently, MLL fusion proteins 
constitutively activate the transcription of previously-transcribed MLL target 
genes. Structure/function analysis has shown that the ability of MLL fusion 
proteins to transform hematopoietic progenitors depends on the recruitment of 
AEP and SL1. Thus, the AEP/SL1-mediated gene activation pathway appears to be 
the central mechanism of MLL fusion-mediated transcriptional activation. 
However, the molecular mechanism by which SL1 activates RNAP2-dependent 
transcription remains largely unclear. This review aims to cover recent 
discoveries of the mechanism of transcriptional activation by MLL fusion 
proteins and to introduce novel roles of SL1 in RNAP2-dependent transcription by 
discussing how the RNAP1 machinery may be involved in RNAP2-dependent gene 
regulation.

Correlates of immune exacerbations in leprosy.

Geluk A(1).

Netherlands. Electronic address: a.geluk@lumc.nl.

Leprosy is still a considerable health threat in pockets of several low and 
middle income countries worldwide where intense transmission is witnessed, and 
often results in irreversible disabilities and deformities due to delayed- or 
misdiagnosis. Early detection of leprosy represents a substantial hurdle in 
present-day leprosy health care. The dearth of timely diagnosis has, however, 
particularly severe consequences in the case of inflammatory episodes, 
designated leprosy reactions, which represent the major cause of 
leprosy-associated irreversible neuropathy. There is currently no accurate, 
routine diagnostic test to reliably detect leprosy reactions, or to predict 
which patients will develop these immunological exacerbations. Identification of 
host biomarkers for leprosy reactions, particularly if correlating with early 
onset prior to development of clinical symptoms, will allow timely interventions 
that contribute to decreased morbidity. Development of a point-of-care (POC) 
test based on such correlates would be a definite game changer in leprosy health 
care. In this review, proteomic-, transcriptomic and metabolomic research 
strategies aiming at identification of host biomarker-based correlates of 
leprosy reactions are discussed, next to external factors associated with 
occurrence of these episodes. The vast diversity in research strategies combined 
with the variability in patient- and control cohorts argues for harmonisation of 
biomarker discovery studies with geographically overarching study sites. This 
will improve identification of specific correlates associated with risk of these 
damaging inflammatory episodes in leprosy and subsequent application to rapid 
field tests.

Lebanon.

AIM: The aim of this study was to compare the translucency parameter (TP) of 
ultratranslucent multilayered (UTML) zirconia according to thickness and layer 
level.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rectangles of UTML zirconia with four layers [dentin 
layer (DEL), first transitional layer (FTL), second transitional layer (STL), 
and enamel layer (ENL)] and four different thicknesses (0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1 mm) 
were milled from blanks. Digital images were taken in a dark studio against 
white and black backgrounds under simulated daylight illumination and 
international commission on illumination (CIE) Lab* color values recorded using 
Photoshop Creative Cloud software. The TP was computed and compared according to 
thickness and layer level using analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by 
Bonferroni post hoc analysis for multiple comparisons. Significance was set at p 
< 0.05.
RESULTS: In each thickness, TP values were similar between any two layers. The 
significant effect of thickness on the TP was observed only in the first two 
layers. In the DEL, translucency was significantly greater at 0.4 mm than all 
other thicknesses. In the FTL, differences were significant between 0.4 and 0.8 
mm and between 0.4 and 1 mm.
CONCLUSION: The investigated zirconia does not seem to show gradational changes 
in relative translucency from dentin to enamel levels regardless of the 
thickness used. Thickness affected the TP only in the first two layers with 
better translu-cency at 0.4 mm.
CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Since relative translucency does not seem to be 
significantly different between layers, clinicians can modify the apicocoronal 
positioning of the UTML layers within the restoration according to the desired 
Chroma without any implications on the clinically perceived translucency. While 
the thickness of 0.4 mm may be suggested for anterior esthetic veneers because 
of its higher translucency, the other thicknesses of 0.6 to 1 mm can be used to 
mask colored abutments in full contour restorations.

A novel gene, AF-1p, fused to HRX in t(1;11)(p32;q23), is not related to AF-4,

Most of the translocations affecting the chromosome band 11q23, frequently seen 
in human acute leukemias, involve a restricted area of the HRX gene. We have 
characterized two t(1;11)(p32;q11) translocations which fuse the HRX gene to a 
novel gene, AF-1p on chromosome 1p32, in two myeloid leukemias. The der (11) 
chromosome expresses the 1368 N-terminal amino acids of HRX, including the 
AT-hook, snRNP and methyltransferase similarities, fused to almost all the AF-1p 
product. The predicted wild type AF-1p product is a 98 kDa acidic protein which 
does not exhibit similarity to the AF-4, AF-9 and ENL gene products. It is 
highly similar to the murine eps 15 gene product, which encodes a cytoplasmic 
phosphoprotein. Our data indicate that AF-1p defines another class of genes 
fused to HRX in 11q23 abnormalities.

The aim of this study is twofold. First, to investigate the use of functional 
categories by two Greek agrammatic aphasics. Second, to discuss the implications 
of our findings for the characterization of the deficit in agrammatism. The 
functional categories under investigation were the following: definite and 
indefinite articles, personal pronouns, aspect, tense, subject-verb agreement, 
wh-pronouns, complementizers and the mood marker na (=to). Based on data 
collected through different methods, it is argued that the deficit in 
agrammatism cannot be described in terms of a structural account but rather by 
means of difficulties in the implementation of grammatical knowledge.

Dysregulation of the oncogenic transcription factor HOXA9 is a prominent feature 
for most aggressive acute myeloid leukemia cases and a strong indicator of poor 
prognosis in patients. Leukemia subtypes with hallmark overexpression of HOXA9 
include those carrying MLL gene rearrangements, NPM1c mutations, and other 
genetic alternations. A growing body of evidence indicates that HOXA9 
dysregulation is both sufficient and necessary for leukemic transformation. The 
HOXA9 mRNA and protein regulation includes multilayered controls by 
transcription factors (such as CDX2/4 and USF2/1), epigenetic factors (such as 
MLL-menin-LEDGF, DOT1L, ENL, HBO1, NPM1c-XPO1, and polycomb proteins), microRNAs 
(such as miR-126 and miR-196b), long noncoding RNAs (such as HOTTIP), 
three-dimensional chromatin interactions, and post-translational protein 
modifications. Recently, insights into the dynamic regulation of HOXA9 have led 
to an advanced understanding of the HOXA9 regulome and provided new cancer 
therapeutic opportunities, including developing inhibitors targeting DOT1L, 
menin, and ENL proteins. This review summarizes recent advances in understanding 
the molecular mechanisms controlling HOXA9 regulation and the pharmacological 
approaches that target HOXA9 regulators to treat HOXA9-driven acute myeloid 
leukemia.

BACKGROUND: Most studies describing the subtypes of lymphoma in Jordan were 
carried out in the 1980s at a time when immunohistochemical facilities were 
unavailable. Using a database established after immunohistochemical studies were 
introduced, we determined the frequency of the various types of nodal and 
extranodal lymphomas in the adult and paediatric Jordanian population. We also 
assessed the incidence of bone marrow involvement at the initial presentation 
for each lymphoma type.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis of the histopathological subtypes of various 
lymphomas was conducted on all primary lymphoma cases diagnosed during a 3-year 
period between January 2001 and December 2003.
RESULTS: Of 347 patients included in the study, 78.4% had non-Hodgkin's lymphoma 
(NHL) and 21.6% had Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL). In the NHL group, diffuse large 
B-cell lymphoma was the most common (28.2%) followed by follicular lymphoma 
(15.6%). In the HL group, the nodular sclerosis variant was the most frequent 
(7.8%) followed by the mixed cellularity type (5.5%). Of all the lymphoma cases, 
the highest incidence of marrow involvement was seen in patients with 
lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma. Forty-nine patients were children (age <15 years) in 
whom Burkitt's lymphoma (15 cases) and HL (14 cases) were the commonest 
subtypes. One-hundred six patients with primary extranodal lymphomas (ENL) 
accounted for 30.5% of all lymphomas.
CONCLUSIONS: There is a higher incidence of NHL in Jordan compared with other 
series in the Middle East. Among the various lymphomas, diffuse large B-cell 
lymphoma is the most commonly encountered lymphoma in adults. Burkitt's lymphoma 
and Hodgkin's disease are the most frequent childhood lymphomas, followed 
closely by lymphoblastic lymphoma.

Involvement of a homolog of Drosophila trithorax by 11q23 chromosomal 
translocations in acute leukemias.

We have identified a human homolog of the Drosophila trithorax protein that is 
structurally altered by 11q23 translocations in acute leukemias. Human trithorax 
(HRX) is a predicted 431 kd protein containing two potential DNA-binding motifs 
consisting of zinc fingers conserved with the fly protein and nonconserved 
amino-terminal "AT hook" motifs related to the DNA-binding motifs in HMG 
proteins. 11q23 translocations disrupt the HRX gene between these two motifs, 
and in a t(11;19)-carrying cell line fusion transcripts are expressed from both 
derivative chromosomes. The more abundant derivative 11 transcript codes for a 
chimeric protein containing the AT hook motifs fused to a previously undescribed 
protein (ENL) from chromosome 19. These data suggest a novel role for a 
trithorax-homologous protein in multilineage human leukemias that may be 
mediated by DNA binding within the minor groove at AT-rich sites, implicated to 
play an important role in bacterial IHF-, yeast datin-, and mammalian 
HMG-mediated gene activation.

Reversal reaction in lepromatous patients induced by a vaccine containing killed 
ICRC bacilli--a report of five cases.

Bhatki WS, Chulawala RG, Bapat CV, Deo MG.

Clinico-pathological features of five cases of lepromatous leprosy exhibiting 
"reversal" reaction with upgrading of lesions following vaccination with ICRC 
vaccine have been described. Two patients also developed ENL. Associated with 
the "reversal" reaction, the patients exhibited lepromin conversion. No evidence 
of fresh nerve lesions was observed in any patient. Besides lepromin conversion, 
occurrence of "reversal" reaction is yet another evidence of immunogenicity of 
the ICRC vaccine.

BACKGROUND: The major factors contributing for nerve damage and permanent 
disabilities in leprosy are type 1 or reversal reactions (RR) and type 2 or 
erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL). Gene profiling of leprosy reactions have shown 
that different pathways are activated during the course of reactions, which is 
consistent with the exacerbated immune response exhibited by these patients.
METHODS: We used qPCR to screen a panel of 90 genes related to the immune 
response in leprosy in RNA-derived peripheral leukocytes of patients with 
(N = 94) and without leprosy reactions (N = 57) in order to define expression 
signatures correlated to RR or ENL.
RESULTS: Our results show that there is a marked signature for RR in the blood, 
comprising genes mostly related to the innate immune responses, including type I 
IFN components, autophagy, parkins and Toll like receptors. On the other hand, 
only Parkin was differentially expressed in the ENL group.
CONCLUSIONS: The data put together corroborates previous work that brings 
evidence that an acute uncontrolled exacerbated immune response designed to 
contain the spread of M. leprae antigens might be cause of RR pathogenesis. 
Identifying a blood profile useful to predict leprosy reactions prior to its 
development might help to reduce the morbidity associated to this disabling 
disease.

Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is the most common type of thyroid carcinoma, 
and our understanding of its pathogenesis is incomplete. To elucidate the 
mechanisms underlying such progression and identify novel diagnostic markers, we 
aimed to discover the underlying gene associated with PTC. Integrated analysis 
of microarray datasets was performed to identify differentially expressed genes 
(DEGs) between PTCs and normal tissues. GO enrichment analysis and KEGG pathway 
enrichment analysis were then performed to uncover the functions of DEGs. 
Furthermore, the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of DEGs was 
constructed. Five GEO datasets were obtained. Totally, 154 DEGs across the 
studies were identified, including 26 upregulated and 128 downregulated DEGs. In 
the PPI network, MLLT1, DLG2, and EFEMP1 were the hub proteins, in which DLG2 
and EFEMP1 were involved in tumor progression. Among the top 10 up- and 
downregulated genes, the dysregulation genes of TPO, CDH16, and MPPED2 may be 
closely related to the tumorigenesis of PTC. By integrated analysis of multiple 
gene expression profiles, we propose that the dysregulation genes of TPO and 
MPPED2 will be the promising diagnostic markers for PTCs.

Monitoring of CML patients while on therapy is vitally important and ENL has 
come up with specific guidelines for the same. Since we are currently talking 
about operational cure, this review shall focus on evaluating the emerging data 
to optimize response. This requires attention to all outstanding controversial 
issues. Only careful, accurate and regular monitoring with specific attention to 
grey areas will help us select first line therapy, decide when to discontinue 
TKIs and also move to second line TKIs in a timely manner.

It is well known that nucleoli of fully grown mammalian oocytes are 
indispensable for embryonic development. Therefore, the embryos originated from 
previously enucleolated (ENL) oocytes undergo only one or two cleavages and then 
their development ceases. In our study the interspecies (mouse/pig) nucleolus 
transferred embryos (NuTE) were produced and their embryonic development was 
analyzed by autoradiography, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and 
immunofluorescence (C23 and upstream binding factor (UBF)). Our results show 
that the re-injection of isolated oocyte nucleoli, either from the pig (P + P) 
or mouse (P + M), into previously enucleolated and subsequently matured porcine 
oocytes rescues their development after parthenogenetic activation and some of 
these develop up to the blastocyst stage (P + P, 11.8%; P + M, 13.5%). In 
nucleolus re-injected 8-cell and blastocyst stage embryos the number of nucleoli 
labeled with C23 in P + P and P + M groups was lower than in control 
(non-manipulated) group. UBF was localized in small foci within the nucleoli of 
blastocysts in control and P + P embryos, however, in P + M embryos the labeling 
was evenly distributed in the nucleoplasm. The TEM and autoradiographic 
evaluations showed the formation of functional nucleoli and de novo rRNA 
synthesis at the 8-cell stage in both, control and P + P group. In the P + M 
group the formation of comparable nucleoli was delayed. In conclusion, our 
results indicate that the mouse nucleolus can rescue embryonic development of 
enucleolated porcine oocytes, but the localization of selected nucleolar 
proteins, the timing of transcription activation and the formation of the 
functional nucleoli in NuTE compared with control group show evident 
aberrations.

Leprosy is a chronic disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae. Although the 
occurrence of leprosy has declined in Saudi Arabia, it has not yet been 
eradicated. To our knowledge, this descriptive retrospective study is the first 
to assess the clinical presentation of leprosy at the time of diagnosis in Saudi 
Arabia. All study subjects were leprosy patients admitted to Ibn Sina hospital, 
the only referral hospital for leprosy in Saudi Arabia, between January 2000 and 
May 2012. A total of 164 subjects, the majority of whom (65%) were between 21 
and 50 years of age, were included, and the male-to-female ratio was 2.8:1. Of 
these 164 patients, 63% were Saudis, and 77% of all admitted patients were from 
the western region. Lepromatous leprosy was observed most frequently (33%), and 
31% of cases had a positive history of close contact with leprosy. At the time 
of diagnosis, 84% of all subjects presented with skin manifestation. The 
prevalence of neurological deficit at the time of diagnosis was 87%. Erythema 
nodosum leprosum (E.N.L.) developed in only 10% of all subjects. Further studies 
are needed to determine the clinical characteristics pertaining to each type of 
leprosy in the region, and training courses in caring for and diagnosing 
patients with leprosy should be organized for health workers.

Determination of urinary lignans and phytoestrogen metabolites, potential 
antiestrogens and anticarcinogens, in urine of women on various habitual diets.

Adlercreutz H, Fotsis T, Bannwart C, Wähälä K, Mäkelä T, Brunow G, Hase T.

Recently two groups of compounds with diphenolic structure, the lignans and the 
isoflavonic phytoestrogens, were detected and identified in human urine and 
other biological fluids. These compounds are of great biological interest 
because they exhibit both in vitro and in vivo weak estrogenic and sometimes 
also antiestrogenic activities and many plant lignans have been shown to have 
anticarcinogenic, antiviral, antifungal and other interesting biological 
effects. The compounds found in relatively large amounts (10-1000 times more 
than estrogens) in urine are modified by intestinal bacteria from plant lignans 
and phytoestrogens, which are present in fiber-rich food such as grain and 
beans. They bind with low affinity to estrogen receptors and preliminary results 
suggest that they may induce production of sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) 
in the liver and in this way may influence sex hormone metabolism and biological 
effects. Five compounds, the lignans enterolactone (Enl), enterodiol (End) and 
the isoflavonic phytoestrogen metabolites daidzein (Da), equol (Eq) and 
O-desmethylangolensin (O-Dma) were measured in urine by gas chromatography-mass 
spectrometry (selected ion monitoring) using deuterated internal standards in 5 
groups of women (total number 53). The members of three dietary groups 
(omnivores, lactovegetarians and macrobiotics) were living in Boston and of two 
groups in Helsinki (omnivores and lactovegetarians). Until now measurements have 
been carried out in 94 72-h samples. The highest mean excretion of the most 
abundant compound, enterolactone, was found in the macrobiotic group and the 
lowest in the omnivoric groups. Total mean 24-h excretion of enterolactone was 
17,680 nmol in the macrobiotics, 4,170 nmol in the Boston lactovegetarians, 
3,650 nmol in the Helsinki lactovegetarians, 2,460 nmol in the Helsinki 
omnivores and 2,050 nmol in the Boston omnivores. The other diphenols followed 
approximately the same pattern. In an earlier study the lowest excretion of 
enterolactone (1,040 nmol/24 h) was found in a group of postmenopausal 
apparently healthy breast cancer patients living in Boston. It is concluded that 
further studies are necessary to elucidate the possible role of these compounds 
in cancer and other diseases. However, the evidence obtained until now seems to 
justify the conclusion that these compounds may be among the dietary factors 
affording protection against hormone-dependent cancers in vegetarians and 
semivegetarians.

While conducting a study to observe bone marrow cytomorphological changes in 
multibacillary leprosy, lipid laden macrophages as seen in sphingolipidoses were 
noted. The present study was planned to observe the occurrence and morphological 
characterization of these macrophages in various types of leprosy. Bone marrow 
records from 48 cases of paucibacillary and 72 cases of multibacillary leprosy 
were analysed. The macrophages accounting at the most for 3.5% of marrow cells 
were observed in 5 cases of paucibacillary and 43 cases of multibacillary 
leprosy with a maximum incidence being observed in patients with ENL (16/17). 
The lipid present in the cytoplasm of these cells could be derived from the 
lipid of the cell wall of Mycobacterium leprae. To the best of our knowledge, 
these cells have not been reported in leprosy so far.

The cellular content of dermal leprous granulomas: an immuno-histological 
approach.

Wallach D, Flageul B, Bach MA, Cottenot F.

An indirect immunofluorescence technique with monoclonal antibodies has been 
used to identify T cells, T helper cells, T suppressor cells, and granulocytes 
in the dermal granulomas of 22 patients with leprosy. In tuberculoid leprosy, T 
helper cells predominated and T suppressor cells were located at the periphery 
of well-circumscribed granulomas. In lepromatous leprosy, the two subsets of T 
cells were numerous in treated patients. In ENL lesions, T cells were more 
numerous and T helper cells predominated. Enumerations of the T cell subsets in 
the dermis and in the blood showed similar changes, but these changes were 
quantitatively more marked in the dermal granulomas.

Type 2 leprosy reaction (T2LR), or Erythema Nodosum Leprosum (ENL), often poses 
a therapeutic challenge to clinicians and commonly requires long courses of 
steroids for control. While immunosuppressants are known to achieve control and 
lower steroid dependence in T2LR, the prospect of managing a severe T2LR in 
conjunction with COVID-19, with the concern of worsening COVID-19 with long-term 
immunosuppression has not previously been encountered. We report a case of 
severe T2LR treated with oral steroids and methotrexate, with COVID-19 infection 
acquired during hospital stay, and a favourable outcome achieved despite the 
continued use of immunosuppressants. We discuss the possible reasons for this 
both in terms of the drug pharmacodynamics and the immunological profile of 
T2LR.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a worldwide threatening 
health issue. The progression of this viral infection occurs in the airways of 
the lungs with an exaggerated inflammatory response referred to as the "cytokine 
storm" that can lead to lethal lung injuries. In the absence of an effective 
anti-viral molecule and until the formulation of a successful vaccine, 
anti-inflammatory drugs might offer a complementary tool for controlling the 
associated complications of COVID-19 and thus decreasing the subsequent 
fatalities. Drug repurposing for several molecules has emerged as a rapid 
temporary solution for COVID-19. Among these drugs is Thalidomide; a 
historically emblematic controversial molecule that harbors an FDA approval for 
treating erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) and multiple myeloma (MM). Based on 
just one-case report that presented positive outcomes in a patient treated 
amongst others with Thalidomide, two clinical trials on the efficacy and safety 
of Thalidomide in treating severe respiratory complications in COVID-19 patients 
were registered. Yet, the absence of substantial evidence on Thalidomide usage 
in that context along with the discontinued studies on the efficiency of this 
drug in similar pulmonary diseases, might cause a significant obstacle for 
carrying out further clinical evaluations. Herein, we will discuss the 
theoretical effectiveness of Thalidomide in attenuating inflammatory 
complications that are encountered in COVID-19 patients while pinpointing the 
lack of the needed evidences to move forward with this drug.

Thalidomide and its one analogue, lenalidomide (CC5103 or revlimid) are recently 
approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma. Multiple myeloma is 
characterized by an overproduction of malignant plasma cells in the bone marrow. 
The journey of thalidomide was started in 1956 when it was marketed as a 
non-barbiturate sedative agent. It was considered as a "wonder drug" that 
provided safe and sound sleep and hence, used to cure morning sickness in 
pregnant women. Later, in 1961, it was withdrawn from the world market due to 
its serious side effects, i.e., teratogenic activity. However, the recent decade 
has witnessed a true renaissance in interest in its broad biological activity. 
In particular, thalidomide was reevaluated and attracted significant attention 
due to its selective inhibitory activity of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), 
which is a clinically important activity against serious diseases such as 
rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, leprosy, AIDS, and various cancers. The 
comeback of thalidomide to the legitimate status of a marketed drug came in 1998 
when it received FDA approval for the treatment of erythema nodosum leprosum 
(ENL). Recently, the drug has got FDA approval for the treatment of multiple 
myeloma. In the last few years, number of thalidomide analogues have been 
synthesized and are in clinical development as a class of immunomodulatory 
drugs. Among these, lenalidomide is more potent than thalidomide, and is also 
non-neurotoxic. It was shown in vitro studies to induce apoptosis or arrest 
growth even in resistant multiple myeloma cell lines, decrease binding of the 
cells to bone marrow stromal cells, and stimulate host natural killer cell 
immunity. It also inhibits tumour growth and decreases angiogenesis. Earlier 
reviews have described the pharmacological aspects of thalidomide and a review 
has focused only on synthetic aspect of thalidomide. However, review focusing on 
chemistry and metabolism and mechanism of biological activity is still lacking. 
In this review, we will concisely describe the therapeutic aspects, metabolism 
and synthesis of thalidomide.

MLL translocations in adult B-cell precursor (BCP) acute lymphoblastic leukemia 
(ALL) are largely restricted to the immature CD10(-) immunophenotypes. MLL-AF4 
is known to be the most frequent fusion transcript, but the exact frequencies of 
MLL aberrations in CD10(-) adult BCP-ALL are unknown. We present a genetic 
characterization of 184 BCR-ABL(-) CD10(-) adult ALL cases (156 cyIg(-), 28 
cyIg(+)) diagnosed between 2001 and 2007 at the central diagnostic laboratory of 
the GMALL study group. Patient samples were investigated by RT-PCR for MLL-AF4, 
MLL-ENL, and MLL-AF9 and by long-distance inverse polymerase chain reaction, 
thus also allowing the identification of unknown MLL fusion partners at the 
genomic level. MLL-AF4 was detected in 101 (54.9%) and MLL-ENL in 11 (6.0%) 
cases. In addition, rare MLL fusion genes were found: 2 MLL-TET1 cases, not 
previously reported in ALL, 1 MLL-AF9, 1 MLL-PTD, a novel MLL-ACTN4, and an 
MLL-11q23 fusion. Chromosomal breakpoints were determined in all 118 positive 
cases, revealing 2 major breakpoint cluster regions in the MLL gene. 
Characteristic features of MLL(+) patients were significantly lower CD10 
expression, expression of the NG2 antigen, a higher white blood count at 
diagnosis, and female sex. Proposals are made for diagnostic assessment.

Specific chromosomal translocations are hallmarks of many human leukemias. The 
basis for these translocation events is poorly understood, but it has been 
assumed that spatial positioning of genes in the nucleus of hematopoietic cells 
is a contributing factor. Analysis of the nuclear 3D position of the gene MLL, 
frequently involved in chromosomal translocations and five of its translocation 
partners (AF4, AF6, AF9, ENL and ELL), and two control loci revealed a 
characteristic radial distribution pattern in all hematopoietic cells studied. 
Genes in areas of high local gene density were found positioned towards the 
nuclear center, whereas genes in regions of low gene density were detected 
closer to the nuclear periphery. The gene density within a 2 Mbp window was 
found to be a better predictor for the relative positioning of a genomic locus 
within the cell nucleus than the gene density of entire chromosomes. Analysis of 
the position of MLL, AF4, AF6 and AF9 in cell lines carrying chromosomal 
translocations involving these genes revealed that the position of the normal 
genes was different from that of the fusion genes, and this was again consistent 
with the changes in local gene density within a 2 Mbp window. Thus, alterations 
in gene density directly at translocation junctions could explain the change in 
the position of affected genes in leukemia cells.

A male 26 years old patient with BB type of leprosy was encountered with a 
typical clinical presentations of up-grading (reversal) Type 1 Lepra Reaction. 
These included sudden appearance of tender, erythematous nodular eruptions 
mimicking ENL, severe constitutional symptoms like high grade fever, malaise, 
vomiting, epistaxis, joint pain and tenosynovitis simulating Type 2 Lepra 
Reaction. To the best of our knowledge, this may be the first such case in our

of optical coherence tomography.

Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a recently emerging non-invasive 
diagnostic tool useful in several medical applications such as ophthalmology, 
cardiology, gastroenterology and dermatology. One of the major problems with OCT 
pertains to its low contrast due to the presence of multiplicative speckle 
noise, which limits the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and obscures low-intensity 
and small features. In this paper, we recommend a new method using the 3D 
curvelet based K-times singular value decomposition (K-SVD) algorithm for 
speckle noise reduction and contrast enhancement of the intra-retinal layers of 
3D Spectral-Domain OCT (3D-SDOCT) images. In order to benefit from the 
near-optimum properties of curvelet transform (such as good directional 
selectivity) on top of dictionary learning, we propose a new plan in dictionary 
learning by using the curvelet atoms as the initial dictionary. For this reason, 
the curvelet transform of the noisy image is taken and then the noisy 
coefficients matrix in each scale, rotation and spatial coordinates is passed 
through the K-SVD denoising algorithm with predefined 3D initial dictionary that 
is adaptively selected from thresholded coefficients in the same subband of the 
image. During the denoising of curvelet coefficients, we can also modify them 
for the purpose of contrast enhancement of intra-retinal layers. We demonstrate 
the ability of our proposed algorithm in the speckle noise reduction of 17 
publicly available 3D OCT data sets, each of which contains 100 B-scans of size 
512×1000 with and without neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) 
images acquired using SDOCT, Bioptigen imaging systems. Experimental results 
show that an improvement from 1.27 to 7.81 in contrast to noise ratio (CNR), and 
from 38.09 to 1983.07 in equivalent number of looks (ENL) is achieved, which 
would outperform existing state-of-the-art OCT despeckling methods.

Although genetic variants in tumor necrosis factor (TNF), mannose binding lectin 
(MBL), and the vitamin D receptor (VDR) have been associated with leprosy 
clinical outcomes, these findings have not been extensively validated. We used a 
case-control study design with 933 patients in Nepal, which included 240 
patients with type I reversal reaction (RR), and 124 patients with erythema 
nodosum leprosum (ENL) reactions. We compared genotype frequencies in 933 cases 
and 101 controls of seven polymorphisms, including a promoter region variant in 
TNF (G -308A), three polymorphisms in MBL (C154T, G161A and G170A), and three 
variants in VDR (FokI, BsmI, and TaqI). We observed an association between TNF 
-308A and protection from leprosy with an odds ratio of 0.52 (95% confidence 
interval = 0.29-0.95, p = 0.016). MBL polymorphism G161A was associated with 
protection from lepromatous leprosy (odds ratio = 0.33, 95% confidence interval 
= 0.12-0.85, p = 0.010). VDR polymorphisms were not associated with leprosy 
phenotypes. These results confirm previous findings of an association of TNF 
-308A with protection from leprosy and MBL polymorphisms with protection from 
lepromatous leprosy. The statistical significance was modest and will require 
further study for conclusive validation.

Comprehension of reversible relative clauses in specifically language impaired 
and normally developing Greek children.

Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece. svoula@enl.auth.gr

This paper aims to investigate the syntactic comprehension of reversible 
relative clauses in a group of eight Greek children with specific language 
impairment (SLI) and two control groups of normally developing children matched 
on chronological and language age, respectively. An experiment using an acting 
out procedure was undertaken. Group analysis revealed that SLI children's 
performance is qualitatively different than that of both control groups. 
Interpreting the data, processes involved in syntactic comprehension are taken 
into consideration. It is claimed that processing demands impede SLI children's 
performance due to a deficit in their competence grammar.

Thalidomide for autoimmune disease.

Hendler SS, McCarty MF.

The therapeutic efficacy of thalidomide in erythema nodosum leprosum suggests 
that thalidomide might play a useful therapeutic role in other human 
immune-complex diseases. Thalidomide has shown anti-inflammatory or 
immunosuppressive actions in several animal models. Current evidence suggests 
that its rapid activity in ENL may result from suppression of neutrophil 
chemotaxis and phagocytosis. Scattered anecdotal clinical reports of apparent 
response to thalidomide in various autoimmune diseases are hardly conclusive, 
but underline the desirability of appropriate pilot trials of thalidomide in 
autoimmune diseases, particularly those in which immune complex deposition plays 
a prominent role. Provided that a contraindication in fertile women is strictly 
observed, thalidomide therapy appears to be quite safe.

PURPOSE: Leprosy is a chronic infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae 
affecting mainly skin and peripheral nerves. Acute inflammatory episodes in the 
borderline immunological spectrum of the disease cause severe nerve and tissue 
damage leading to deformities. Finding of any serological marker for leprosy 
reactions will help in prediction of reactions and in early treatment 
intervention. The objective of this study was to measure the serum circulatory 
levels of Interleukin 17F (IL 17F) and to correlate the levels with type 1 and 
type 2 reactional states and with clinico-histopathological spectrum of leprosy. 
We studied IL 17F to delineate its role and its clinical implications in leprosy 
reactions.
METHODS: Patients were classified based on the Ridley DS and Jopling WH 
Classification and blood samples (5 ml each) were collected from 80 active 
untreated leprosy cases in Type 1 reaction (T1R), 21 cases in Type 2 (Erythema 
Nodosum Leprosum ENL) reaction (T2R), 80 cases without reaction (NR), and 94 
non-leprosy cases (NL). Serum was separated and measured for IL 17F levels using 
ELISA (Commercial Kits, R&D Systems Inc., USA).
RESULTS: IL 17F levels were significantly higher in the T1R group when compared 
to the NR group (p < 0.001). The borderline lepromatous group showed the highest 
levels of IL 17F among the other groups in the disease spectrum. Bacteriological 
index (BI) showed negative correlation with the IL 17F levels.
CONCLUSION: The results specify that serum circulatory levels of IL 17F are 
elevated during T1Rs in the borderline spectrum of the disease and thus may play 
a role in the regulation of inflammatory responses associated with reactions in 
leprosy.

Fast gradient high performance liquid chromatography method with UV detection 
for simultaneous determination of seven angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors 
together with hydrochlorothiazide in pharmaceutical dosage forms and spiked 
human plasma and urine.

The development of a reversed phase liquid chromatographic method for the 
simultaneous determination of seven angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) 
inhibitors; five drugs namely benazepril HCl (BZL), enalapril maleate (ENL), 
fosinopril sodium (FSP), lisinopril (LSP) and ramipril (RMP) and two metabolites 
captopril disulfide (CPD) and enalaprilat (ENT) together with 
hydrochlorothiazide (HCT) is described. The method can serve as a substitute for 
many published papers for the analysis of the targeted compounds with or without 
hydrochloothiazide in pharmaceutical formulations as well as in spiked human 
plasma and urine samples. The method utilizes a simple gradient procedure for 
the separation in a 11 min run time using acetonitrile aqueous ammonia buffer 
(pH 9) solution and an Extend RP-C18 (25 μm particle size, 4.6 mm×250 mm, 
Agilent) HPLC column. The effluent was monitored on a UV detector at 215 nm. The 
effect of pH, solvent strength and analysis time on the peak shape and 
quantification were carefully studied in order to optimize the method. Adopting 
the proposed procedure, the analytes produce well-shaped peaks with good linear 
relationship over the investigated concentration ranges. The limits of detection 
(LOD) and limits of quantification (LOQ) from standard drug solutions lie in the 
range of 17-64 and 56-212 ng mL(-1), respectively. Correlation coefficient 
values (r) higher than 0.997 were obtained for all the studied drugs in spiked 
human plasma and urine samples. The intra-day and inter-day precision of the 
method was evaluated with relative standard deviation values being satisfactory 
for their purposed analysis. The method was validated with respect to 
specificity, recovery, accuracy, precision and linearity.

Molecular findings in childhood leukemia in Brazil: high frequency of MLL-ENL 
Fusion/t(11;19) in infant leukemia.

Translocations involving chromosome 11q23 are frequently found in pediatric 
leukemia, especially in infants. The mixed lineage leukemia (MLL)-AF4 
fusion/t(4;11) is mostly found in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and MLL-AF9 
fusion/t(9;11) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We study 441 consecutive new 
cases of childhood leukemia diagnosed in Brazil. Chromosomal translocation was 
determined solely by conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 72 out of 
265 ALL and in 43 out of 103 AML. MLL-AF4 fusion/t(4;11) was detected in 3 out 
of 265 ALL and MLL-AF9 fusion/t(9;11) in 4 out of 103 of AML. MLL-rearrangements 
were presented in 7 out of 23 infant leukemia, whose 5 were MLL-ENL 
fusion/t(11;19). No fusion MLL-AF4 fusion/t(4;11) was found. Other translocation 
frequencies differed from that reported for an American population suggesting 
interethnic differences on chromosomal translocations frequencies in acute 
leukemia.

Misguided transcriptional elongation causes mixed lineage leukemia.

Fusion proteins composed of the histone methyltransferase mixed-lineage leukemia 
(MLL) and a variety of unrelated fusion partners are highly leukemogenic. 
Despite their prevalence, particularly in pediatric acute leukemia, many 
molecular details of their transforming mechanism are unknown. Here, we provide 
mechanistic insight into the function of MLL fusions, demonstrating that they 
capture a transcriptional elongation complex that has been previously found 
associated with the eleven-nineteen leukemia protein (ENL). We show that this 
complex consists of a tight core stabilized by recursive protein-protein 
interactions. This central part integrates histone H3 lysine 79 methylation, RNA 
Polymerase II (RNA Pol II) phosphorylation, and MLL fusion partners to stimulate 
transcriptional elongation as evidenced by RNA tethering assays. 
Coimmunoprecipitations indicated that MLL fusions are incorporated into this 
complex, causing a constitutive recruitment of elongation activity to MLL target 
loci. Chromatin immunoprecipitations (ChIP) of the homeobox gene A cluster 
confirmed a close relationship between binding of MLL fusions and transcript 
levels. A time-resolved ChIP utilizing a conditional MLL fusion singled out 
H3K79 methylation as the primary parameter correlated with target expression. 
The presence of MLL fusion proteins also kept RNA Pol II in an actively 
elongating state and prevented accumulation of inhibitory histone methylation on 
target chromatin. Hox loci remained open and productive in the presence of MLL 
fusion activity even under conditions of forced differentiation. Finally, 
MLL-transformed cells were particularly sensitive to pharmacological inhibition 
of RNA Pol II phosphorylation, pointing to a potential treatment for MLL. In 
summary, we show aberrant transcriptional elongation as a novel mechanism for 
oncogenic transformation.

AML1-Evi-1 specifically transforms hematopoietic stem cells through fusion of 
the entire Evi-1 sequence to AML1.

The t(3;21) chromosomal translocation seen in blastic crisis of chronic myeloid 
leukemia and secondary leukemias results in a formation of a chimeric protein 
AML1-Evi-1, which suppresses wild-type AML1 function. Loss of AML1 function 
causes expansion of hematopoietic progenitor cells, whereas it is not sufficient 
for the development of leukemia. To identify essential mechanisms through which 
AML1-Evi-1 exerts full leukemogenic potential, we introduced AML1-Evi-1 and its 
mutants in murine bone marrow cells, and evaluated their transforming activities 
by colony replating assays. The transforming activity of AML1-Evi-1 was lost 
when any of the known functional domains of Evi-1 was deleted from the chimeric 
protein, and forced expression of Evi-1 did not transform the AML1-deleted bone 
marrow cells. Unlike the MLL-ENL and AML1-ETO leukemia-related chimeric 
proteins, AML1-Evi-1 could transform only the hematopoietic stem cell fraction. 
Moreover, AML1-Evi-1-transformed cells show a cell-marker profile distinct from 
that of the cells transformed by AML1-ETO, which also suppresses AML1 function. 
Thus, leukemogenic activity of AML1-Evi-1 may be due to activation of molecular 
mechanisms distinct from those activated by MLL-ENL or AML1-ETO in the 
hematopoietic stem cell fractions.

Reciprocal rearrangements of the MLL gene are among the most common chromosomal 
abnormalities in both Acute Lymphoblastic and Myeloid Leukemia. The MLL gene, 
located on the 11q23 chromosomal band, is involved in more than 40 recurrent 
translocations. In the present study, we describe the development and validation 
of a biochip-based assay designed to provide a comprehensive molecular analysis 
of MLL rearrangements when used in a standard clinical pathology laboratory. A 
retrospective blind study was run with cell lines (n=5), and MLL positive and 
negative patient samples (n=31), to evaluate assay performance. The limits of 
detection determined on cell line data were 10(-1), and the precision studies 
yielded 100% repeatability and 98% reproducibility. The study shows that the 
device can detect frequent (AF4, AF6, AF10, ELL or ENL) as well as rare partner 
genes (AF17, MSF). The identified fusion transcripts can then be used as 
molecular phenotypic markers of disease for the precise evaluation of minimal 
residual disease by RQ-PCR. This biochip-based molecular diagnostic tool allows, 
in a single experiment, rapid and accurate identification of MLL gene 
rearrangements among 32 different fusion gene (FG) partners, precise breakpoint 
positioning and comprehensive screening of all currently characterized MLL FGs.

Pentoxifylline (PTX), a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, is known to downregulate 
tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) secretion induced by lipopolysacchride 
(LPS) and gamma interferon (IFN-gamma). We have had limited success in treating 
leprosy reactions, including erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL), in which TNF-alpha 
has been identified as a major proinflammatory cytokine. PTX inhibited 
production of NO (IC50 approximately equal to 1.0 mg/ml) and TNF-alpha (IC50 
approximately equal to 0.05 mg/ml) in a dose-dependent fashion. As little as 0.5 
mg/ml of PTX decreased NO production and 0.01 mg/ml of PTX inhibited TNF-alpha 
production. Western blot analyses demonstrated that iNOS was suppressed by PTX. 
Northern blot analyses showed significant reduction of TNF-alpha mRNA. We 
conclude that PTX is an effective inhibitor of lipoarabinomannan (LAM)-induced 
TNF-alpha production at both the product and transcriptional levels in our 
macrophage cell line. PTX also showed moderate inhibition of NO at the product 
level as well as translation of iNOS.

Little is known about B-lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) that lacks expression of 
terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT). To address this, we performed the 
largest study to date of TdT-negative B-ALL using data from St. Jude Total XV 
and XVI clinical trials. Compared to TdT-positive B-ALL (n = 896), TdT-negative 
B-ALL (n = 21) was associated with younger age (median, 1.4 versus 6.8 years, 
P < 0.001), higher white blood cell count (median, 52.8 versus 9.9 × 109/L, 
P < 0.001), absence of hyperdiploidy (0 versus 27.8%, P = 0.002), KMT2A 
rearrangement (100 versus 1.9%, P < 0.001), and inferior 5-year event-free 
survival (EFS) (76.2 versus 90.3%, P = 0.047). In the context of 
KMT2A-rearranged B-ALL (n = 38), TdT-negativity was significantly associated 
with the MLLT1 rearrangement partner (P = 0.026) but was not independently 
predictive of survival, suggesting that the high-risk features of TdT-negative 
B-ALL are secondary to underlying KMT2A rearrangements. Finally, we compared the 
sensitivity of TdT-negativity to neuron-glial antigen 2 (NG.2) expression for 
the detection of KMT2A rearrangements and found that 63% of KMT2A-rearranged 
B-ALL cases not identified by NG.2 were TdT-negative. The results of this study 
expand the spectrum of immunophenotypic features that are specific for high-risk 
KMT2A rearrangements in pediatric B-ALL and can be readily implemented using 
existing standard acute leukemia flow cytometry panels.

Ovarian cancer, one of the three leading malignancies in women, has high 
incidence and mortality worldwide. It is hard to diagnose until very late stages 
and the 5-year survival rate is very low, due mostly to its distant metastasis. 
Chemotherapy is currently the most common treatment to inhibit cancer growth, 
but long-term use could result in resistance and tumor recurrence in addition to 
damages to normal tissues and functions of the patients. In order to achieve 
safe and curative effects against cancers, many investigators have focused their 
attention on traditional Chinese herbal medicines. Paclitaxel, a natural 
antitumor agent, has significant effects on advanced malignancies including 
ovarian cancer and is in the standard front-line treatment. Additional natural 
anticancer substances have continually been discovered for their high 
effectiveness and low side-effects in ovarian cancer prevention and therapy. In 
this chapter, we summarize recent work on a selected group of natural 
components, including lignans, ellagic acid, luteolin, mangiferin, and 
Acanthopanax senticosus, which have all been demonstrated to reduce the progress 
of epithelial ovarian cancer in a dose-depend manner, by both in vitro and in 
vivo experiments. The mechanisms of the anticancer activities by these natural 
components involve expression suppression of MMP2 and MMP9.

PCANet based nonlocal means method for speckle noise removal in ultrasound 
images.

Speckle reduction remains a critical issue for ultrasound image processing and 
analysis. The nonlocal means (NLM) filter has recently attached much attention 
due to its competitive despeckling performance. However, the existing NLM 
methods usually determine the similarity between two patches by directly 
utilizing the gray-level information of the noisy image, which renders it 
difficult to represent the structural similarity of ultrasound images 
effectively. To address this problem, the NLM method based on the simple deep 
learning baseline named PCANet is proposed by introducing the intrinsic features 
of image patches extracted by this network rather than the pixel intensities 
into the pixel similarity computation. In this approach, the improved two-stage 
PCANet is proposed by using Parametric Rectified Linear Unit (PReLU) activation 
function instead of the binary hashing and block histograms in the original 
PCANet. This model is firstly trained on the ultrasound database to learn the 
convolution kernels. Then, the trained PCANet is utilized to extract the 
intrinsic features from the image patches in the pre-denoised version of the 
noisy image to be despeckled. These obtained features are concatenated together 
to determine the structural similarity between image patches in the NLM method, 
based on which the weighted mean of all pixels in a search window is computed to 
produce the final despeckled image. Extensive experiments have been conducted on 
a variety of images to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over 
several well-known despeckling algorithm and the PCANet based NLM method using 
ReLU function and sigmoid function. Visual inspection indicates that the 
proposed method outperforms the compared methods in reducing speckle noise and 
preserving image details. The quantitative comparisons show that among all the 
evaluated methods, our method produces the best structural similarity index 
metrics (SSIM) values for the synthetic image, as well as the highest equivalent 
number of looks (ENL) value for the simulated image and the clinical ultrasound 
images.

The aim of this study was to identify immunobiological subgroups in 133 infant 
acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cases as assessed by their immunophenotype, 
immunoglobulin (Ig) and T-cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangement pattern, and 
the presence of mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) rearrangements. About 70% of cases 
showed the pro-B-ALL immunophenotype, whereas the remaining cases were common 
ALL and pre-B-ALL. MLL translocations were found in 79% of infants, involving 
MLL-AF4 (41%), MLL-ENL (18%), MLL-AF9 (11%) or another MLL partner gene (10%). 
Detailed analysis of Ig/TCR rearrangement patterns revealed IGH, IGK and IGL 
rearrangements in 91, 21 and 13% of infants, respectively. Cross-lineage TCRD, 
TCRG and TCRB rearrangements were found in 46, 17 and 10% of cases, 
respectively. As compared to childhood precursor-B-ALL, Ig/TCR rearrangements in 
infant ALL were less frequent and more oligoclonal. MLL-AF4 and MLL-ENL-positive 
infants demonstrated immature rearrangements, whereas in MLL-AF9-positive 
leukemias more mature rearrangements predominated. The immature Ig/TCR pattern 
in infant ALL correlated with young age at diagnosis, CD10 negativity and 
predominantly with the presence and the type of MLL translocation. The high 
frequency of immature and oligoclonal Ig/TCR rearrangements is probably caused 
by early (prenatal) oncogenic transformation in immature B-lineage progenitor 
cells with germline Ig/TCR genes combined with a short latency period.

Antispermatozoal antibodies in leprosy with special reference to their 
morphological patterns.

Gupta SC, Singh PA, Bajaj AK, Budhraja BK, Tripathi A.

Sixty two male patients with polar leprosy--38 lepromatous and 24 tuberculoid 
types were investigated for the presence of antispermatozoal antibodies with 
special reference to their morphological patterns. Antibodies were detected by 
three different immunological techniques. Sperm agglutination was found to be 
the most sensitive. The incidence of antibodies was higher in patients with 
lepromatous leprosy and was directly proportional to the duration of the disease 
in both types of leprosy. Morphologically, head-to-head type of agglutination 
was observed in 50 percent of the patients, mixed in 41.7 percent and 
tail-to-tail type in 8.3 percent. There was no correlation between the number of 
ENL attacks and the incidence of anti-bodies. In polar tuberculoid leprosy 
patients the histological findings of testicular biopsy indicated cell mediated 
tissue damage occurring in a non-infective form.

Singhal AL, Parvez M, Chadda VS, Misra SN.

Study of serum alpha-1 antitrypsin by agar gel electrophoresis was carried out 
in 25 patients of various forms of leprosy including 9 cases of Erythema nodosum 
leprosum, and was compared with findings in 25 healthy controls. The level of 
serum alpha-1 antitrypsin in healthy subjects ranged from 211 mg% to 602 mg% 
with a mean level of 290.92 mg% +/- 86.82 mg, have p value 0.1, while in leprosy 
patients of various types ranged from 129 mg% to 702 mg% with mean level of 
405.84 mg% +/- 152.70. Nine patients of lepromatous leprosy with ENL had marked 
elevation of serum alpha-1 antitrypsin and level was 376 to 720 mg% with a mean 
level of 562.65% +/- 106.62, statistically significant.

Occurrence of MLL (Mixed Lineage Leukemia) gene rearrangements indicates poor 
prognosis in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. This is the first study to 
report the positive rate and distribution characteristics of MLL rearrangements 
in AML patients in north China. We used multiplex nested real time PCR (RT-PCR) 
to screen for incidence of 11 MLL rearrangements in 433 AML patients. Eleven MLL 
rearrangements included (MLL-PTD, MLL-AF9, MLL-ELL, MLL-AF10, MLL-AF17, MLL-AF6, 
MLL-ENL, MLL-AF1Q, MLL-CBP, MLL-AF1P, MLL-AFX1). There were 68 AML patients with 
MLL rearrangements, and the positive rate was 15.7%. MLL-PTD (4.84%) was 
detected in 21 patients, MLL-AF9 in 15, (3.46%), MLL-ELL in 10 (2.31%), MLL-AF10 
in 8 (1.85%), MLL-AF1Q in 2 (0.46%), 3 cases each of MLL-AF17, MLL-AF6, MLL-ENL 
(0.69% each), a and single case each of MLL-CBP, MLL-AF1P, and MLL-AFX1 (0.23% 
each). The highest rate of MLL rearrangements was found in 24 patients with M5 
subtype AML, occurring in 24 cases (35.3%). MLL rearrangements occurred in 21 
patients with M2 subtype AML (30.9%), and in 10 patients with M4 subtype AML 
(14.7%). Screening fusion genes by multiplex nested RT-PCR is a convenient, 
fast, economical, and accurate method for diagnosis and predicting prognosis of 
AML.

Tumor necrosis factor: status in reactions in leprosy before and after 
treatment.

Bhattacharya SN(1), Chattopadhaya D, Saha K.

Author information:
(1)Department of Dermatology and Venereology, Lady Hardinge Medical College, New 
Delhi, India.

BACKGROUND: Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) is an important mediator of 
immunologic responses to chronic infections.
METHOD: Sera from 25 patients with acute reactions (6 with type 1 upgrading, 8 
with type 1 downgrading, and 11 with type 2 reaction) were assayed for TNF 
before treatment and after clinical remission of the acute episode. The results 
were compared with serum TNF levels in healthy controls and fresh pauci- and 
multibacillary leprosy patients.
RESULTS: TNF levels in acute reactions were higher than in the control groups 
(significant only in upgrading reaction). In type 1 reaction, serum TNF 
concentrations fell to approximately the levels of the control patients 
following treatment and clinical remission. In type 2 reaction, however, levels 
of TNF were seen to rise further (became statistically significant) as a result 
of therapy induced clinical remission.
CONCLUSIONS: The rise in TNF-alpha level in reactions in leprosy is significant 
and indicates its active role in immunopathogenesis. The corresponding decline 
in TNF-alpha levels seen following regression of type 1 (lepra) reactions was 
not observed in the case of type 2 (ENL) reaction. This probably reflects the 
enhancement of cellular immunity in such cases and/or an attempt by the 
immunologic process to overcome specific inhibitors.

Role of surgical decompression in ulnar neuritis of leprosy.

Malaviya GN, Ramu G.

The present study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of neurolysis in 
relieving the pain of acute painful neuritis and assess its effect on the 
sensory motor deficit. Thirty eight ulnar nerves were operated and followed up 
for 8 to 125 weeks. Following surgery relief from pain was gratifying. However 
the pain recurred in cases of lepromatous leprosy in subsequent episodes of ENL 
reaction. Sensory recovery was appreciable and occurred within 8 weeks. Four 
cases had 75% recovery; five had 50 to 75% recovery and 11 cases had up to 50% 
recovery. Motor recovery took a longer time to appear. Proximal supplied muscles 
recovered first followed by smaller muscles. In most cases further deterioration 
of muscle power was prevented. Only 3 cases deteriorated. Recovery was more 
pronounced in LL cases. Patients with shorter duration of acute symptoms and 
history of smaller number of attacks of acute painful neuritis showed a higher 
incidence and better grade of recovery.

The aim of the study was to describe the clinical and epidemiological 
characteristics, anatomic and histologic distribution, and treatment results of 
extranodal lymphomas (ENLs), diagnosed and treated in the public health system 
in Chile. We included patients with ENL diagnosed from 1998 to 2014, in 17 
cancer centers, registered prospectively in the database of the National Adult 
Cancer Program (PANDA) of the Ministry of Health. Treatment was based on the 
local protocols for each lymphoma subtype. Extranodal lymphoma was documented in 
1215 of 4907 non-Hodgkin lymphomas diagnosed in that period (25%). Median age 
was 59 years (range, 16-95), and 55% were female. The gastrointestinal (GI) 
tract was the most common location (38%), followed by the head and neck (24%) 
and the skin (15%). B-cell lymphomas accounted for 78% of cases, diffuse large 
B-cell lymphoma being the most common histologic subtype (68%). Mycosis 
fungoides/Sezary syndrome was the most frequent T-cell subtype (36%), followed 
by NK/T-cell lymphomanasal type (24%). In comparison with western countries, 
Chile showed a significantly high prevalence of NK/T-cell lymphoma nasal type, 
while the frequency of B-cell ENL and the anatomic distribution appeared 
similar, being GI the most commonly involved site.

Reversible growth factor dependency and autonomy during murine myelomonocytic 
leukemia induced by oncogenes.

Medical Research, Parkville, VIC 3052, Australia.

When murine fetal liver cells were transduced with either of the human acute 
myeloid leukemia fusion oncogenes MLL-ENL or MLL-AF9 and then transplanted to 
irradiated recipient mice, myelomonocyte leukemias rapidly developed from the 
transplanted cells. Analysis of initial events following transduction showed 
that both oncogenes immediately induced a wide range of enhanced proliferative 
states, the most extreme of which could generate continuous lines of cells. 
Maturation defects accompanied the enhanced proliferative states. At all times, 
the transformed cells exhibited complete dependency on hematopoietic growth 
factors, particularly GM-CSF and IL-3. Myelomonocytic leukemic cells from 
primary or transplanted mice formed colonies in semisolid agar. The large 
majority were dependent on hematopoietic growth factors, but a low frequency of 
autonomous colonies was also detected. Unexpectedly, reculture of autonomous 
leukemic colonies generated large numbers of growth factor-dependent clonogenic 
progeny. Similarly, transplanted clonal autonomous leukemic cells produced 
leukemias containing a majority of factor-dependent cells. Conversely, 
recultures of factor-dependent colonies in vitro always produced small numbers 
of autonomous colonies among the dependent progeny. The reversible relationship 
between factor dependency and autonomy is surprising because autonomy would have 
been presumed to represent the final, irreversible, leukemic state.

Gelatinases A and B (matrix metalloproteinase 2 [MMP-2] and MMP-9, respectively) 
can induce basal membrane breakdown and leukocyte migration, but their role in 
leprosy skin inflammation remains unclear. In this study, we analyzed clinical 
specimens from leprosy patients taken from stable, untreated skin lesions and 
during reactional episodes (reversal reaction [RR] and erythema nodosum leprosum 
[ENL]). The participation of MMPs in disease was suggested by (i) increased MMP 
mRNA expression levels in skin biopsy specimens correlating with the expression 
of gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), 
(ii) the detection of the MMP protein and enzymatic activity within the 
inflammatory infiltrate, (iii) increased MMP levels in patient sera, and (iv) 
the in vitro induction of MMP-9 by Mycobacterium leprae and/or TNF-alpha. It was 
observed that IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, MMP-2, and MMP-9 mRNA levels were higher in 
tuberculoid than lepromatous lesions. In contrast, interleukin-10 and tissue 
inhibitor of MMP (TIMP-1) message were not differentially modulated. These data 
correlated with the detection of the MMP protein evidenced by 
immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy. When RR and ENL lesions were 
analyzed, an increase in TNF-alpha, MMP-2, and MMP-9, but not TIMP-1, mRNA 
levels was observed together with stronger MMP activity (zymography/in situ 
zymography). Moreover, following in vitro stimulation of peripheral blood cells, 
M. leprae induced the expression of MMP-9 (mRNA and protein) in cultured cells. 
Overall, the present data demonstrate an enhanced MMP/TIMP-1 ratio in the 
inflammatory states of leprosy and point to potential mechanisms for tissue 
damage. These results pave the way toward the application of new therapeutic 
interventions for leprosy reactions.

Leukemogenic MLL fusion proteins bind across a broad region of the Hox a9 locus, 
promoting transcription and multiple histone modifications.

Milne TA(1), Martin ME, Brock HW, Slany RK, Hess JL.

Philadelphia, USA.

Chromosome translocations involving the mixed lineage leukemia gene MLL are 
associated with aggressive acute leukemias in both children and adults. 
Leukemogenic MLL fusion proteins delete the MLL SET domain Lys(4) 
methyltransferase activity and fuse MLL to 1 of >40 different translocation 
partners. Some MLL fusion proteins involve nuclear proteins that are 
transcriptional activators, whereas others have transcriptional activating 
activity but instead dimerize the truncated MLL molecule. Both types of MLL 
fusion proteins enforce persistent expression of Hox a9 and Meis1, which is 
pivotal for leukemogenesis through mechanisms that remain obscure. Here, we show 
that nuclear and dimerizable forms of MLL bind with a similar pattern to the Hox 
a9 locus that overlaps the distribution of wild-type MLL and deregulate 
transcription of three isoforms of Hox a9. Induction of MLL fusion protein 
activity is associated with increased levels of histone acetylation and Lys(4) 
methylation at Hox target genes. In addition, the MLL-ENL-ER protein, but not 
dimerized MLL, also induces dimethylation of histone H3 at Lys(79), suggesting 
alternative mechanisms for transcriptional activation.

The degradation of Mycobacterium leprae by a comparison of its staining 
properties.

Ridley MJ.

The disintegration of Mycobacterium leprae is revealed by a study of its 
acid-fast component, its non-acid-fast cell walls using methenamine silver, and 
its BCG-positive cytoplasmic component. Solid bacilli stain by the three stain 
techniques used to identify these products, but the BCG component is 
demonstrated only with difficulty and appears granular. Degradation of M. leprae 
is fairly rapid in BT, BB, and BL, and clearance of bacillary products occurs 
almost simultaneously because of the destruction of the cell walls. However, 
clearance is slower in nerves and BCG-positive material persists. The breakdown 
of cell walls is slow in LL and their clearance is delayed, but BCG-positive 
material is cleared as fast as it leaks out. ENL appears to coincide with a more 
rapid breakdown and release of disintegration products from degenerate 
macrophages. The Mitsuda reaction appears as an epithelioid cell granuloma after 
complete degradation of M. leprae with residual BCG positive material at 30

This study aimed to improve the transdermal delivery of lidocaine hydrochloride 
(LidH) using elastic nano-liposomes (ENLs) and microneedle (MN) array 
pretreatment. LidH-containing ENLs were prepared using soybean 
phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol, with Span 80 or Tween 80, using a 
reverse-phase evaporation method. The ENL particle size, stability, and 
encapsulation efficiency (EE) were characterized and optimized based on the 
component ratio, pH, and type of surfactant used. In vitro transdermal diffusion 
study was performed on MN-pretreated mouse skin using Franz diffusion cells. The 
anesthetic effects of LidH in various formulations after dermal application were 
evaluated in vivo in rats by measuring the tail withdrawal latency after 
photothermic stimulation. Stable LidH-loaded Tween 80 or Span 80 ENLs were 
obtained with particle sizes of 115.8 and 146.6 nm and EEs of 27% and 20%, 
respectively. The formulations did not exert any cytotoxicity in HaCaT cells. 
Tween 80 and Span 80 ENL formulations showed enhanced LidH delivery on 
pretreated mice skin in vitro and prolonged the anesthetic effect in vivo 
compared to that by LidH application alone. LidH-loaded ENLs applied to 
MN-pretreated skin can shorten the onset time and prolong the anesthetic effect 
safely, which merits their further optimization and practical application.

A novel strategy for the absolute quantification of selenium (Se) included in 
selenoprotein P (SEPP1), an important biomarker for human nutrition and disease, 
including diabetes and cancer, is presented here for the first time. It is based 
on the use of species-specific double isotope dilution mass spectrometry (SSIDA) 
in combination with HPLC-ICP-MS/MS for the determination of protein bound Se 
down to the peptide level in a complex plasma matrix with a total content of Se 
of 105.5 μg kg(-1). The method enabled the selective Se speciation analysis of 
human plasma samples without the need of extensive cleanup or preconcentration 
steps as required for traditional protein mass spectrometric approaches. To 
assess the method accuracy, two plasma reference materials, namely, BCR-637 and 
SRM1950, for which literature data and a reference value for SEPP1 have been 
reported, were analyzed using complementary hyphenated methods and the 
species-specific approach developed in this work. The Se mass fractions obtained 
via the isotopic ratios (78)Se/(76)Se and (82)Se/(76)Se for each of the 
Se-peptides, namely, ENLPSLCSUQGLR (ENL) and AEENITESCQUR (AEE) (where U is 
SeCys), were found to agree within 2.4%. A relative expanded combined 
uncertainty (k = 2) of 5.4% was achieved for a Se (as SEPP1) mass fraction of 
approximately 60 μg kg(-1). This work represents a systematic approach to the 
accurate quantitation of plasma SEPP1 at clinical levels using SSIDA 
quantification. Such methodology will be invaluable for the certification of 
reference materials and the provision of reference values to clinical 
measurements and clinical trials.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the frequency of coinfections in 
leprosy patients and whether there is a relationship between the presence of 
coinfections and the development of leprosy reactional episodes.
METHOD: A cross-sectional study based on an analysis of the medical records of 
the patients who were treated at the Leprosy Clinics of the Ribeirão Preto 
Medical School, University of São Paulo, was conducted from 2000 to 2010. 
Information was recorded regarding the age, sex, clinical status, WHO 
classification, treatment, presence of reactions and coinfections. Focal and 
systemic infections were diagnosed based on the history, physical examination, 
and laboratory tests. Multinomial logistic regression was used to evaluate the 
associations between the leprosy reactions and the patients' gender, age, WHO 
classification and coinfections.
RESULTS: Two hundred twenty-five patients were studied. Most of these patients 
were males (155/225 = 68.8%) of an average age of 49.31±15.92 years, and the 
most prevalent clinical manifestation was the multibacillary (MB) form (n = 
146), followed by the paucibacillary (PB) form (n = 79). Erythema nodosum 
leprosum (ENL) was more prevalent (78/122 = 63.9%) than the reversal reaction 
(RR) (44/122 = 36.1%), especially in the MB patients (OR 5.07; CI 2.86-8.99; 
p<0.0001) who exhibited coinfections (OR 2.26; CI 1.56-3.27; p<0.0001). 
Eighty-eight (88/225 = 39.1%) patients exhibited coinfections. Oral coinfections 
were the most prevalent (40/88 = 45.5%), followed by urinary tract infections 
(17/88 = 19.3%), sinusopathy (6/88 = 6.8%), hepatitis C (6/88 = 6.8%), and 
hepatitis B (6/88 = 6.8%).
CONCLUSIONS: Coinfections may be involved in the development and maintenance of 
leprosy reactions.

c-Myb binds MLL through menin in human leukemia cells and is an important driver 
of MLL-associated leukemogenesis.

Mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) is a proto-oncogene frequently involved in 
chromosomal translocations associated with acute leukemia. These chromosomal 
translocations commonly result in MLL fusion proteins that dysregulate 
transcription. Recent data suggest that the MYB proto-oncogene, which is an 
important regulator of hematopoietic cell development, has a role in 
leukemogenesis driven by the MLL-ENL fusion protein, but exactly how is unclear. 
Here we have demonstrated that c-Myb is recruited to the MLL histone methyl 
transferase complex by menin, a protein important for MLL-associated leukemic 
transformation, and that it contributes substantially to MLL-mediated 
methylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4). Silencing MYB in human leukemic 
cell lines and primary patient material evoked a global decrease in H3K4 
methylation, an unexpected decrease in HOXA9 and MEIS1 gene expression, and 
decreased MLL and menin occupancy in the HOXA9 gene locus. This decreased 
occupancy was associated with a diminished ability of an MLL-ENL fusion protein 
to transform normal mouse hematopoietic cells. Previous studies have shown that 
MYB expression is regulated by Hoxa9 and Meis1, indicating the existence of an 
autoregulatory feedback loop. The finding that c-Myb has the ability to direct 
epigenetic marks, along with its participation in an autoregulatory feedback 
loop with genes known to transform hematopoietic cells, lends mechanistic and 
translationally relevant insight into its role in MLL-associated leukemogenesis.

Chromosomal translocations involving the mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene are 
often observed in acute leukemias of both myeloid and lymphocytic origin. 
Expression of MLL fusion proteins is known to induce malignant transformation of 
normal blood progenitors; however, molecular mechanisms of this process are 
still poorly understood. In this study we investigated the effect of several 
frequently detected MLL fusion proteins on p53 transcriptional activity. Our 
data show that MLL-AF9, MLL-AF10, MLL-ENL, and MLL-ELL substantially 
down-regulate p53-mediated induction of p21, MDM2, and Bax in response to DNA 
damage. Furthermore, we identify the reduction in p53 acetylation by p300 as a 
major mechanism of the inhibitory effect of MLL leukemic fusions. Our data 
suggest that abrogation of p53 functional activity can be a common feature of 
MLL fusion-mediated leukemogenesis.

Thiothalidomides: novel isosteric analogues of thalidomide with enhanced 
TNF-alpha inhibitory activity.

Thalidomide is being increasingly used in the clinical management of a wide 
spectrum of immunologically-mediated and infectious diseases, and cancers. 
However, the mechanisms underlying its pharmacological action are still under 
investigation. In this regard, oral thalidomide is clinically valuable in the 
treatment of erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) and multiple myeloma and 
effectively reduces tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) levels and 
angiogenesis in vivo. This contrasts with its relatively weak effects on 
TNF-alpha and angiogenesis in in vitro studies and implies that active 
metabolites contribute to its in vivo pharmacologic action and that specific 
analogues would be endowed with potent activity. Our focus in the structural 
modification of thalidomide is toward the discovery of novel isosteric active 
analogues. In this regard, a series of thiothalidomides and analogues were 
synthesized and evaluated for their TNF-alpha inhibitory activity against 
lipopolysacharide (LPS)-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), 
This was combined with a PBMC viability assay to differentiate reductions in 
TNF-alpha secretion from cellular toxicity. Two isosteric analogues of 
thalidomide, compounds 15 and 16, that mostly reflect the parent compound, 
together with the simple structure, dithioglutarimide 19, potently inhibited 
TNF-alpha secretion, compared to thalidomide, 1. The mechanism underpinning this 
most likely is posttranscriptional, as each of these compounds decreased 
TNF-alpha mRNA stability via its 3'-UTR. The potency of 19 warrants further 
study and suggests that replacement of the amide carbonyl with a thiocarbonyl 
may be beneficial for increased TNF-alpha inhibitory action. In addition, an 
intact phthalimido moiety appeared to be requisite for TNF-alpha inhibitory 
activity.

Tamil Nadu, South India.

During a period of 9 years, four male patients with HIV and Hansen's disease 
were detected in Tamil Nadu, South India. The sequence as to which infection 
came first is not known. All had high-risk sexual behavior with commercial sex 
workers and a past history of genital ulcer disease. Their spectrum of leprosy 
was multibacillary. Patient no. 1 had pure neural leprosy of the lepromatous 
type, which is rare. He also had a single episode of type 1 reaction which did 
not require steroid therapy. Despite having taken inadequate treatment, patient 
no. 2 remained clinically and bacteriologically quiescent after 4 years of 
follow up. He had a low CD4 count of 330 cells/mm3. The third patient completed 
a full course of multibacillary multidrug therapy, and a year later is 
clinically and bacteriologically inactive. The fourth patient died of AIDS 
within 2 months of the dual diagnosis.

PIP: Since the detection of HIV infection in the Christian Medical College and 
Hospital, Tamil Nadu, in 1986, patients attending the sexually transmitted 
disease (STD) clinic are counselled and screened for HIV antibodies using ELISA. 
Over the course of 9 years, 4 males, all from Tamil Nadu, were identified at the 
clinic with concurrent HIV infection and leprosy. The men were aged 20-27 years 
and had had multiple heterosexual contacts with prostitutes and a past history 
of genital ulcer disease. They were in the multibacillary (MB) spectrum of the 
disease as evidenced by the presence of numerous acid-fast bacilli in the nerve 
biopsy in 1 case and positive skin smears in the other 3 cases. Mitsuda tests 
conducted in 3 patients were negative, consistent with the MB spectrum of 
Hansen's disease (HD). The patients had concurrent infections, but it is unclear 
which infection occurred first. One patient developed a type 1 reaction which 
rapidly recovered with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. Observation of the 
patient over 3 years revealed no further episodes of reaction. No patient 
developed an erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) reaction. One patient died 2 months 
after being diagnosed with HIV and HD. The other patients were followed for 3-5 
years after the diagnosis of dual infection. Over that period, neither their 
leprosy worsened nor did their HIV infection progress to clinical AIDS. HIV 
infection therefore does not appear to influence an infection with Mycobacterium 
leprae.

Unusual MLL gene rearrangements were found in bone marrow cells of four patients 
with acute myeloid leukemia. A combination of conventional and molecular 
cytogenetic methods were used to describe translocations 
t(9;12;11)(p22;p13;q23), t(11;19)(q23;p13.3), and t(10;11)(p12;23) and inverted 
insertion ins(10;11)(p12;q23.3q23.1). Partial nontandem duplication of the MLL 
gene was identified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in all 
cases. The duplication, which included MLL exons 2 through 8-9, was interrupted 
by a cryptic insertion of one or two exons from the respective MLL partner gene: 
MLLT10, MLLT3, or MLLT1.

BACKGROUND: Enterolignans are important biomarkers of microbiota diversity, with 
higher levels indicating greater diversity. Diet and inflammation have been 
shown to play a role in maintaining microbiota diversity. This study examined 
whether inflammatory potential of diet, as measured by the Dietary Inflammatory 
Index (DII®) has an impact on levels of urinary enterolignans in the National 
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2003-2008. We also carried out 
construct validation of the DII with C-reactive protein (CRP).
METHODS: Data came from NHANES 2003-2008. Enterolignans [enterodiol (END) and 
enterolactone (ENL)] and CRP were assayed from urine and serum specimens, 
respectively. Energy-adjusted DII (E-DII) scores were calculated from food 
intakes assessed using 24-h dietary recalls and expressed per 1000 calories 
consumed. Associations were examined using survey-based multivariable linear and 
logistic regression for enterolignans, and logistic regression for CRP.
RESULTS: After multivariable adjustment, higher E-DII scores (i.e., indicating 
a relatively more pro-inflammatory diet) were associated with lower levels of 
creatinine-normalized END [beta coefficient (b)DIIquartile4vs1 = - 1.22; 95% 
CI = - 0.69, - 1.74; Ptrend ≤ 0.001] and ENL (bDIIquartile4vs1 = - 7.80; 95% 
CI = - 5.33, - 10.26; Ptrend ≤ 0.001). A positive association was also observed 
when enterolignans were dichotomized based on the cut-off of the 75th percentile 
value. In this same sample, the E-DII also was associated with CRP ≥ 3 mg/l 
(ORDIIcontinuous = 1.12; 95% CI 1.05, 1.19).
CONCLUSION: In these NHANES data, there was an association between E-DII score 
and enterolignans. This study also provided construct validation of the E-DII 
using CRP in a nationally representative sample. The results indicate that 
dietary inflammatory potential is associated with urinary enterolignans, a 
potential marker for microbiota diversity. However, studies are required to 
understand the direct association between DII and microbiota.

Advances in the treatment of reactions in leprosy.

Ganj, Agra.

Morbidity in leprosy is almost always due to reactions. Similarly, to a great 
extent, deformities in leprosy are the consequence of reactions occurring both 
in borderline patients (type 1 or reversal reactions) and in lepromatous 
patients (type 2 or ENL reactions). Over the last three decades, work has 
centred around finding who are prone to getting the reactions, identifying the 
risk factors and improving the management of reactions in order to alleviate 
quickly the suffering and prevent and reverse nerve damage consequent to 
reactions. Though several new drugs have been tried and found somewhat useful, 
corticosteroids and thalidomide continue to be the mainstay in the management of 
leprosy reactions. A brief review of the current understanding is presented.

A novel translocation (17;19)(p13;p13) in a patient with acute myelomonocytic

University, Magdeburg, Germany.

We report on a patient with acute myeloid leukemia (AML M4) and a so far 
unrecorded translocation (17;19). The leukemia transformed from a 
myeloproliferative disorder (MPD) and showed a progressive fatal course. 
Following transformation, all leukemic cells showed an apparently balanced 
translocation (17;19)(p13;p13). The breakpoint regions harbor genes such as TP53 
(17p13) and E2A, ENL, or LYL1 (19p13), which could be relevant in 
leukemogenesis. We suspect that the translocation (17;19)(p13;p13) may be a 
prognostic factor for transformation from chronic MPD to acute leukemia.

Pregnancy and leprosy neuropathy.

Duncan ME.

Erratum in
    Indian J Lepr 1996 Jul-Sep;68(3):250.

Women with leprosy (even apparently cured) run a serious risk of deterioration 
in nerve function when they become pregnant. During pregnancy and lactation the 
woman with leprosy may suffer: relapse, reactivation and transient exacerbation 
maximally in late pregnancy; ENL in the first and third trimesters, continuing 
with nerve damage postpartum; RR maximally postpartum, even after MDT and RFT; 
neuritis affecting almost 50% of women in any pregnancy/lactation, in most cases 
as "silent" neuritis with new motor and sensory loss, even after MDT-RFT, and 
stocking-and-glove anaesthesia even in PB women and post MDT-RFT. Those 
incubating the infection develop overt disease frequently in reaction. This 
tragic cycle can only be stopped by a combination of: (i) leprologists and 
leprosy control personnel understanding the problems of leprosy in pregnant and 
lactating mothers; (ii) well-planned health education for leprosy patients, and 
both leprosy and maternal health care workers and (iii) the highest standard of 
clinical supervision during pregnancy, prolonged lactation and at regular 
intervals during the woman's reproductive life, even after she would normally be 
released from surveillance after completion of multiple drug treatment (MDT).

In Type II lepromatous reaction, there is exacerbation of humoral immunity, 
classified as Gell & Coombs Type III hypersensitivity reaction. It is more 
common in lepromatous borderline (LB) and lepromatous lepromatous (LL) patients. 
Our objective was to study the clinical and laboratorial expressions of 
lepromatous Type II reactions, establishing concordances between them, and for 
this the medical records of leprosy patients observed at the Clementino Fraga 
Filho University Hospital of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro 
(HUCFF/UFRJ) were reviewed. There were a total of 358 leprosy cases over a 
period of 12 years. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data of 133 patients 
with Type II reaction were collected. Among the 133 patients, 19 were classified 
as borderline borderline (BB), 15 (11.3%) as LB, and 97 (72.9%) as LL. Mitsuda 
intradermal reaction was negative in all the 49 patients who underwent this 
test. Histopathologic study confirmed the diagnosis. Lepromatous patients (LP) 
presented positive bacilloscopy more frequently (73.91% of 68 patients) than 
borderline patients (BP) (26.9% of 24 patients). Among BP, 44% presented 
erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL), which was seen in 71% of LP. Erythema 
multiforme (EM) occurred in 32% of BP and 13% of LP. Lucio phenomenon (LPh) was 
observed in 8 of 34 BP (23.6%), and 15 of 97 LP (15.4%). The understanding of 
the laboratorial and clinical presentations of reactional episodes are relevant 
to the development of preventive and therapeutic strategies, in order to avoid 
potential complications and comorbidities that cause disability, paralysis,

Cytotoxic T cells (CTL) may play an important role in host defence against 
mycobacterial infections. CD4 CTL are preferentially induced by mycobacteria, 
but both CD4 and CD8 CTL may be necessary components of a protective immune 
response. The 65-kD mycobacterium heat shock protein (hsp65) is a poor inducer 
of CTL in multibacillary leprosy (MB) patients. In this study we evaluate the 
possible role of cytokines in modulating the cytotoxic activity of CTL from 
leprosy patients and normal individuals (N) against autologous macrophages 
presenting Mycobacterium leprae hsp65. Our results show that hsp65-specific CTL 
were generated from both CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes. In N, individual cytokines as 
well as the combination of them were able to modify the hsp65-induced cytotoxic 
activity. The effect of cytokines on leprosy patients' lymphocytes was different 
in MB and paucibacillary (PB) patients. Thus, IL-6, IL-2, IFN-gamma or TNF-alpha 
did not modify the generation of hsp65-CTL from either MB (with or without an 
erythema nodosum episode (ENL)) or PB. In all the patients the simultaneous 
addition of two cytokines was required in order to increase CTL generation. In 
MB, IL-6 plus IFN-gamma or IL-2 increased both CD4 and CD8 CTL, while TNF-alpha 
plus IFN-gamma up-regulated only CD4 CTL. In PB, CD8 CTL were prominent with 
IL-6 plus IFN-gamma, while the increase was significant in CD4 CTL with IL-6 
plus IL-2. Down-regulation of CTL was observed by addition of IL-4, IL-10, 
anti-IFN-gamma or anti-TNF-alpha in N controls. Our data demonstrate that 
IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha must be present for at least the first 60 h of the 
induction stage in order to generate full hsp65 CTL. Hence, IFN-gamma and 
TNF-alpha would be key factors in the generation of hsp65 CTL.

Electrogustometry in Hansen's disease (study of 225 cases).

Rathi SS, Chaturvedi VN, Raizada RM, Jain SK.

An electrogustometric study of 225 cases of Hansen's disease revealed impairment 
of taste in 55.1% of the cases. It was related to the duration of the disease, 
and was seen in 74.6% of the cases of lepromatous leprosy, 49.3% of the cases of 
borderline leprosy, and 41.3% of tuberculoid leprosy cases. Only in lepromatous 
cases was complete ageusia seen (9.39% of cases). All of the cases having 
lesions in the oropharynx and those with facial nerve palsy revealed impairment 
of taste, but it was not related to the type of antileprosy drug used or to the 
development of ENL reaction.

Extranodal lymphoma (ENL) occurs in approximately 30%-40% of all patients with 
non-Hodgkin lymphoma and has been described in almost all organs and tissues. 
However, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is the most common histological subtype 
of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, primarily arising in the retroperitoneal region. In 
this article, we report a rare case of an adult male diagnosed with primary 
diffuse large B-cell lymphoma of the gluteal and adductor muscles with 
aggressive bone involvement. All appropriate radiological and histopathological 
studies were done for diagnosis and staging. After discussion with the lymphoma 
multidisciplinary team, it was agreed to start on R-CHOP protocol (rituximab, 
cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin (Adriamycin), vincristine (Oncovin®), and 
prednisone) as the standard of care, which was later changed to R-CODOX-M/R-IVAC 
protocol (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine (Oncovin®), doxorubicin, and 
high-dose methotrexate alternating with rituximab, ifosfamide, etoposide, and 
high-dose cytarabine) due to inadequate response. Due to the refractory 
aggressive nature of the disease, subsequent decision of the multidisciplinary 
team was salvage chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplant. The aim of 
this case report was to describe and evaluate the clinical presentation and 
important radiological features of extranodal lymphoma affecting the 
musculoskeletal system.

Articulatory variability during consonant production by Greek speakers with 
hearing impairment: an electropalatographic study.

Nicolaidis K(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Theoretical and Applied Linguistics, Aristotle University of 
Thessaloniki, Greece. knicol@enl.auth.gr

This study uses the technique of electropalatography to investigate 
lingual-palatal contact patterns during the production of the consonants /t, k, 
s, x, n, l, [symbol: see text] by four Greek speakers with profound hearing 
impairment and with differences in the intelligibility of their speech. The 
study provides a detailed description of their tongue-palate contact patterns 
and discusses some of the articulatory parameters that differentiate consonantal 
articulation between speakers with normal hearing and hearing impairment. 
Deviant patterns were found for the majority of consonants and involved 
substitutions, distortions, and epenthesis of segments. The segments that 
deviated from normal for all speakers were the fricative /s/, the palatal 
obstruents [c] and [ç], and the tap [symbol: see text]. Significant differences 
in articulatory variability during consonantal production were also found. The 
study discusses deviant patterns in consonant production in relation to the 
differences in intelligibility among the speakers and with reference to data 
from previous studies.

Despite of medical disaster caused by thalidomide in 1960s, the drug came to 
clinical use again for the treatment of erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) and 
multiple myeloma. Recently, a new generation of children affected by thalidomide 
intake by their mothers during pregnancy has been identified in Brazil. In the 
past few years, there is the great enhancement in our understanding of the 
molecular mechanisms and targets of thalidomide with the help of modern OMICS 
technologies. However, understanding of cardiac-specific anomalies in fetus due 
to thalidomide intake by the respective mother has not been explored fully. At 
organ level, thalidomide causes congenital heart diseases, limb deformities in 
addition to ocular, and neural and ear abnormalities. The period of morning 
sickness and cardiogenesis is synchronized in pregnant women. Therefore, 
thalidomide intake during the first trimester could affect cardiogenesis 
severely. Thalidomide intake in pregnant women either causes miscarriage or 
heart abnormalities such as patent ductus arteriosus, ventricular septal defect 
(VSD), atrial septal defect (ASD), and pulmonary stenosis in survivors. In the 
present study, we identified a novel morphological defect (lump) in the heart of 
thalidomide-treated chick embryos. We characterized the lump at morphological, 
histo-pathological, oxidative stress, electro-physiological, and gene expression 
level. To our knowledge, here, we report the very first electrophysiological 
characterization of embryonic heart affected by thalidomide treatment.

PURPOSE: Lignans such as secoisolariciresinol diglucoside in flaxseed, are 
metabolizes to bioactive mammalian lignans of END and ENL. Because mammalian 
lignans have chemical structural similarity to the natural estrogen, they are 
thought to behave like selective estrogen receptor modulators and therefore have 
anticancer effect against hormone-related cancers. We isolated a series of 
lignan compounds, named as Vitexins, from the seed of Chinese herb Vitex 
Negundo.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We purified several Vitexin lignan compounds. Cytotoxic and 
antitumor effects were analyzed in cancer cells and in tumor xenograft models. 
In vivo metabolism of Vitexins was determined in rat.
RESULTS: Contrasts to the classic lignans, Vitexins were not metabolized to END 
and ENL. A mixture of Vitexins EVn-50 and purified Vitexin compound 
6-hydroxy-4-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-3-hydroxymethyl-7-methoxy-3, 
4-dihydro-2-naphthaldehyde have cytotoxic effect on breast, prostate, and 
ovarian cancer cells and induces apoptosis with cleavage in poly ADP ribose 
polymerase protein, up-regulation of Bax, and down-regulation of Bcl-2. This 
induction of apoptosis seems to be mediated by activation of caspases because 
inhibition of caspases activity significantly reduced induced apoptosis. We 
showed a broad antitumor activity of EVn-50 on seven tumor xenograft models 
including breast, prostate, liver, and cervical cancers. Consistent with in 
vitro data, EVn-50 treatment induced apoptosis, down-regulated of Bcl-2, and 
up-regulated Bax in tumor xenografts.
CONCLUSION: Vitexin is a class of nature lignan compounds, whose action and 
anticancer effect is mediated by the mechanisms different from the classic 
lignans. Vitexin-induced antitumor effect and cytotoxic activity is exerted 
through proapoptotic process, which is mediated by a decreased Bcl-2/Bax ratio 
and activation of caspases.

An historical and clinical review of the interaction of leprosy and pregnancy: a 
cycle to be broken.

Since earliest history the person with leprosy has been shut out from society. 
Laws have prohibited marriage and allowed divorce of those with leprosy. 
Segregation of the sufferer from the rest of society has been followed by 
separation of the sexes, and of leprous parents from their children. With the 
advent of antileprotic drugs, first dapsone then multidrug therapy (MDT), 
infection can be treated, individuals made non-infectious, and the pool of 
infection in the community reduced. The clinical signs of leprosy are due not to 
the degree of infection but to the immunological status of the host. Hormonal 
changes at puberty and in pregnancy can cause variation of the host's immune 
status. Pregnancy in women with leprosy is a hazardous undertaking. First 
appearance of leprosy, reactivation of the disease and relapse in 'cured' 
patients is likely to occur particularly in the third trimester of pregnancy. 
Leprosy reactions caused by variation in cell mediated and humoral immunity are 
triggered off by pregnancy: type 1 reaction (reversal reaction, RR) occurs post 
partum, while type 2 reaction (erythema nodosum leprosum, ENL) peaks in late 
pregnancy. Both types of reaction continue long into lactation. Neuritis with 
loss of both sensory and motor function is associated with relapse and reaction. 
Relapse, reaction and nerve damage, especially 'silent neuritis', with 
subsequent deformity and disability, occur not only in women on apparently 
effective treatment but also in those who have received MDT and have been 
released from treatment (RFT). To prevent disability, research is urgently 
needed into the mechanisms of early and late reaction and neuritis. Pregnancy is 
not only a trigger factor for reaction but an ideal in vivo model for research. 
Up to 20% of children born to mothers with leprosy may develop leprosy by 
puberty. While early leprosy in young children is self-healing, when marriage 
and childbearing take place at an early age the daughters of mothers with 
leprosy are likely to run the risk of experiencing the adverse effects of 
pregnancy on leprosy. Increased awareness and health education, as well as long 
term surveillance of 'cured' leprosy patients, are essential to break a 
potentially vicious cycle of leprosy and pregnancy. Women with cured leprosy 
could play an important role in screening for and detection of both early 
leprosy in children and late, post-MDT RFT, nerve damage in their mothers.

We report four experiments that examined whether bilinguals' production of one 
language is affected by the syntactic properties of their other language. 
Greek-English and English-Greek highly proficient fluent bilinguals produced 
sentence completions following subject nouns whose translation had either the 
same or different number. We manipulated whether participants produced 
completions in the same language as the subject (the source language; 
one-language production) or the other language (the non-source language; 
two-language production), and whether they used only one language or both 
languages within the experimental session. The results demonstrated that the 
grammar systems of both languages were activated during both one-language and 
two-language production. The effects of the non-source language were 
particularly enhanced in two-language utterances, when both languages were used 
in the experiment, and when it was the bilinguals' native language. We interpret 
our results in terms of a model of bilingual sentence production.

Fifty three multibacillary leprosy cases were treated with two regimens of MDT 
L1 consisting of Rifampicin, Dapsone and Ethionamide and L2 consisting of 
Rifampicin, Dapsone and clofazimine. The results were compared at regular 
intervals and at the end of the study (24 months). Clinical inactivity, 
bacteriological negativity, ENL reactions, upgrading reactions were seen in L1 
group in 65%, 4.54%, 50% and 41% of cases respectively while 65%, 25.8%, 30% and 
45% respectively in L2 regimen group. Zero percent morphological Index was 
achieved in all cases in L1 regimen 90% in L2 regimen cases. No viability was 
found on mouse foot pad inoculation after 6 months in L1 while after 18 months 
in L2 cases.

Nine patients of leprosy, 5 BL and 4 LL who developed jaundice during the course 
of disease were investigated. Two LL patients developed jaundice during ENL 
reaction. There was slight hepatomegaly in 5 patients and moderate splenomegaly 
in 3 only. There was significant alterations in liver enzymes and serum 
bilirubin in all patients. The abnormalities of the enzymes levels persisted for 
abnormally long periods even when the serum bilirubin had come down and the 
patients had become asymptomatic. Blood for HBsAg and anti-HAV IgM was negative 
in all the patients except one in whom HBsAg was positive. Drugs could not be 
implicated as the cause of jaundice, all patients maintained recovery even after 
restarting antileprosy drugs. The possibility of non A, non B viruses producing 
hepatitis during the course of disease is brought out. Course of prolonged 
jaundice in leprosy is compared with other diseases which could result in a 
similar situation.

MLL encodes a histone methyltransferase that is critical in maintaining gene 
expression during embryonic development and hematopoiesis. 11q23 translocations 
result in the formation of chimeric MLL fusion proteins that act as potent 
drivers of acute leukemia. However, it remains unclear what portion of the 
leukemic genome is under the direct control of MLL fusions. By comparing 
patient-derived leukemic cell lines, we find that MLL fusion-bound genes are a 
small subset of that recognized by wild-type MLL. In an inducible MLL-ENL model, 
MLL fusion protein binding and changes in H3K79 methylation are limited to a 
specific portion of the genome, whereas wild-type MLL distributes to a much 
larger set of gene loci. Surprisingly, among 223 MLL-ENL-bound genes, only 12 
demonstrate a significant increase in mRNA expression on induction of the fusion 
protein. In addition to Hoxa9 and Meis1, this includes Eya1 and Six1, which 
comprise a heterodimeric transcription factor important in several developmental 
pathways. We show that Eya1 has the capacity to immortalize hematopoietic 
progenitor cells in vitro and collaborates with Six1 in hematopoietic 
transformation assays. Altogether, our data suggest that MLL fusions contribute 
to the development of acute leukemia through direct activation of a small set of 
target genes.

HDGF-related protein 2 (HRP-2) is a member of the Hepatoma-Derived Growth 
Factor-related protein family that harbors the structured PWWP and Integrase 
Binding Domain, known to associate with methylated histone tails or cellular and 
viral proteins, respectively. Interestingly, HRP-2 is a paralog of Lens 
Epithelium Derived Growth Factor p75 (LEDGF/p75), which is essential for 
MLL-rearranged (MLL-r) leukemia but dispensable for hematopoiesis. Sequel to 
these findings, we investigated the role of HRP-2 in hematopoiesis and MLL-r 
leukemia. Protein interactions were investigated by co-immunoprecipitation and 
validated using recombinant proteins in NMR. A systemic knockout mouse model was 
used to study normal hematopoiesis and MLL-ENL transformation upon the different 
HRP-2 genotypes. The role of HRP-2 in MLL-r and other leukemic, human cell lines 
was evaluated by lentiviral-mediated miRNA targeting HRP-2. We demonstrate that 
MLL and HRP-2 interact through a conserved interface, although this interaction 
proved less dependent on menin than the MLL-LEDGF/p75 interaction. The systemic 
HRP-2 knockout mice only revealed an increase in neutrophils in the peripheral 
blood, whereas the depletion of HRP-2 in leukemic cell lines and transformed 
primary murine cells resulted in reduced colony formation independently of 
MLL-rearrangements. In contrast, primary murine HRP-2 knockout cells were 
efficiently transformed by the MLL-ENL fusion, indicating that HRP-2, unlike 
LEDGF/p75, is dispensable for the transformation of MLL-ENL leukemogenesis but 
important for leukemic cell survival.

The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in the brain is involved in the pathogenesis 
of hypertension. We hypothesized that inhibition of angiotensin-converting 
enzyme (ACE) in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) attenuates 
angiotensin II (ANG II)-induced hypertension via restoring neurotransmitters and 
cytokines. Rats underwent subcutaneous infusions of ANG II or saline and 
bilateral PVN infusions of ACE inhibitor enalaprilat (ENL, 2.5μg/h) or vehicle 
for 4weeks. ANG II infusion resulted in higher mean arterial pressure and 
cardiac hypertrophy as indicated by increased whole heart weight/body weight 
ratio, whole heart weight/tibia length ratio, left ventricular weight/tibia 
length ratio, and mRNA expressions of cardiac atrial natriuretic peptide and 
beta-myosin heavy chain. These ANG II-infused rats had higher PVN levels of 
glutamate, norepinephrine, tyrosine hydroxylase, pro-inflammatory cytokines 
(PICs) and the chemokine monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and lower PVN 
levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid, interleukin (IL)-10 and the 67-kDa isoform of 
glutamate decarboxylase (GAD67), and higher plasma levels of PICs, 
norepinephrine and aldosterone, and lower plasma IL-10, and higher renal 
sympathetic nerve activity. However, PVN treatment with ENL attenuated these 
changes. PVN microinjection of ANG II induced increases in IL-1β and IL-6, and a 
decrease in IL-10 in the PVN, and pretreatment with angiotensin II type 1 
receptor (AT1-R) antagonist losartan attenuated these changes. These findings 
suggest that ANG II infusion induces an imbalance between excitatory and 
inhibitory neurotransmitters and an imbalance between pro- and anti-inflammatory 
cytokines in the PVN, and PVN inhibition of the RAS restores neurotransmitters 
and cytokines in the PVN, thereby attenuating ANG II-induced hypertension and

The so-called Yaf9, ENL, AF9, Taf14, and Sas5 (YEATS) domain-containing 
proteins, hereafter referred to as YD proteins, take control over the 
transcription by multiple steps of regulation either involving epigenetic 
remodelling of chromatin or guiding the processivity of RNA polymerase II to 
facilitate elongation-coupled mRNA 3' processing. Interestingly, an increasing 
amount of evidence suggest a wider repertoire of YD protein's functions spanning 
from non-coding RNA regulation, RNA-binding proteins networking, 
post-translational regulation of a few signalling transduction proteins and the 
spindle pole formation. However, such a large set of non-canonical roles is 
still poorly characterized. Notably, four paralogous of human YEATS domain 
family members, namely eleven-nineteen-leukaemia (ENL), ALL1-fused gene from 
chromosome 9 protein (AF9), YEATS2 and glioma amplified sequence 41 (GAS41), 
have a strong link to cancer yet new findings also highlight a potential novel 
role in neurological diseases. Here, in an attempt to more comprehensively 
understand the complexity of four YD proteins and to gain more insight into the 
novel functions they may accomplish in the neurons, we summarized the YD 
protein's networks, systematically searched and reviewed the YD genetic variants 
associated with neurodevelopmental disorders and finally interrogated the model 
organism Drosophila melanogaster.

leukemia using simplified multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain 
reaction.

Multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (mRT-PCR) has recently 
emerged as an alternative to cytogenetics. We designed and used simplified 
mRT-PCR system as a molecular screen for acute leukemia. Fifteen fusion 
transcripts were included: BCR-ABL1, PML-RARA, ZBTB16-RARA, RUNX1-RUNX1T1, 
CBFB-MYH11, DEK-NUP214, TCF3-PBX1, ETV6-RUNX1, MLL-AFF1, MLL-MLLT4, MLL-MLLT3, 
MLL-MLLT10, MLL-ELL, MLL-MLLT1, and MLL-MLLT6. A total of 121 diagnostic acute 
leukemia specimens were studied, comparing the mRT-PCR system with standard 
cytogenetics. Fifty-six cases (46.3%) had fusion transcripts revealed by our 
mRT-PCR assay. The concordance rate between mRT-PCR and cytogenetics was 91.7%. 
However, false negative results were found in three cases who have inv(16), 
t(4;11) or t(11;19)(q23;p13.1), respectively. Seven cryptic translocations 
including ETV6-RUNX1, MLL-MLLT3, MLL-MLLT4, and PML-RARA were detected. This 
mRT-PCR assay is a useful screening tool in acute leukemia because it provides 
rapid and reliable detection of clinically important chimeric transcripts. In 
addition, cryptic translocations provide additional genetic information that 
could be clinically useful.

restricted feeding.

The circadian clock in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) responds to light and 
regulates peripheral circadian rhythms. Feeding regimens also reset the clock, 
so that time-restricted feeding (RF) dictates rhythms in peripheral tissues, 
whereas calorie restriction (CR) affects the SCN clock. To better understand the 
influence of RF vs. CR on circadian rhythms, we took advantage of the transgenic 
alphaMUPA mice that exhibit spontaneously reduced eating, and can serve as a 
model for CR under ad libitum feeding, and a model for temporal CR under RF 
compared with wild type (WT) mice. Our results show that RF advanced and 
generally increased the amplitude of clock gene expression in the liver under LD 
in both mouse types. However, under disruptive light conditions, RF resulted in 
a different clock gene phase in WT mice compared with alphaMUPA mice, suggesting 
a role for the reduced calories in resetting the SCN that led to the change of 
phase in alphaMUPA mice. Comparison of the RF regimen in the two lighting 
conditions in WT mice revealed that mPer1, mClock, and mBmal1 increased, whereas 
mPer2 decreased in amplitude under ultradian light in WT mice, suggesting a role 
for the SCN in determining clock gene expression in the periphery during RF. In 
summary, herein we reinforce a role for calorie restriction in resetting the SCN 
clock, and unravel a role for the SCN in determining peripheral rhythms under 
RF.

The design, synthesis, and self-assembly of the first dual hydrophilic triblock 
copolypeptide vesicles, R(H)(m)E(n)L(o) and K(P)(m)R(H)(n)L(o), is reported. 
Variation of the two distinct hydrophilic domains is used to tune cellular 
interactions without disrupting the self-assembled structure. The aqueous 
self-assemblies of these triblock copolypeptides in water are characterized 
using microscopy and DLS. Cell culture studies are used to evaluate cytotoxicity 
as well as intracellular uptake of the vesicles. The ability of polypeptides to 
incorporate ordered chain conformations that direct self-assembly, combined with 
the facile preparation of functional, multiblock copolypeptide sequences of 
defined lengths, allow the design of vesicles attractive for development as drug 
carriers.

Effect of clofazimine: detailed studies of small intestine functions.

Bhasin DK, Kumar B, Broor SL, Kaur S, Malik AM, Mehra SK.

Twenty one patients of leprosy were studied for gastrointestinal symptoms and 
submitted to detailed intestinal absorption tests and jejunal biopsy before and 
after the institution of Clofazimine therapy. Fifteen patients were administered 
100 mg orally daily for 3 months, while six patients with ENL received 300 mg of 
the drug for 6 weeks initially and then 100 mg daily. Mild diarrhoea and 
abdominal symptoms occurred in four patients, fecal fat excretion increased in 
one patient but Schilling's and d-Xylose tests did not alter. No significant 
changes were produced by Clofazimine therapy in jejunal mucosa. Clofazimine 
crystals were seen in the lamina properia of one patient, the overlying mucosa 
was normal. No correlation was found between the abnormality in mucosal pattern, 
crystal deposition, absorption parameters or symptomatology and doses of drug 
taken.

MLL-fusion proteins are potent inducers of oncogenic transformation, and their 
expression is considered to be the main oncogenic driving force in ∼10% of human 
acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. These oncogenic fusion proteins are 
responsible for the initiation of a downstream transcriptional program leading 
to the expression of factors such as MEIS1 and HOXA9, which in turn can replace 
MLL-fusion proteins in overexpression experiments. To what extent MLL fusion 
proteins act on their own during tumor initiation, or if they collaborate with 
other transcriptional regulators, is unclear. Here, we have compared gene 
expression profiles from human MLL-rearranged AML to normal progenitors and 
identified the myeloid tumor suppressor C/EBPα as a putative collaborator in 
MLL-rearranged AML. Interestingly, we find that deletion of Cebpa rendered 
murine hematopoietic progenitors completely resistant to MLL-ENL-induced 
leukemic transformation, whereas C/EBPα was dispensable in already established 
AMLs. Furthermore, we show that Cebpa-deficient granulocytic-monocytic 
progenitors were equally resistant to transformation and that C/EBPα 
collaborates with MLL-ENL in the induction of a transcriptional program, which 
is also apparent in human AML. Thus, our studies demonstrate a key role of 
C/EBPα in MLL fusion-driven transformation and find that it sharply demarcates 
tumor initiation and maintenance.

Oncogenic transformation requires unlimited self-renewal. Currently, it remains 
unclear whether a normal capacity for self-renewal is required for acquiring an 
aberrant self-renewal capacity. Our results in a new conditional transgenic 
mouse showed that a mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) fusion oncogene, MLL-ENL, at an 
endogenous-like expression level led to leukemic transformation selectively in a 
restricted subpopulation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) through upregulation 
of promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (Plzf). Interestingly, forced expression 
of Plzf itself immortalized HSCs and myeloid progenitors in vitro without 
upregulation of Hoxa9/Meis1, which are well-known targets of MLL fusion 
proteins, whereas its mutant lacking the BTB/POZ domain did not. In contrast, 
depletion of Plzf suppressed the MLL-fusion-induced leukemic transformation of 
HSCs in vitro and in vivo. Gene expression analyses of human clinical samples 
showed that a subtype of PLZF-high MLL-rearranged myeloid leukemia cells was 
closely associated with the gene expression signature of HSCs. These findings 
suggested that MLL fusion protein enhances the self-renewal potential of normal 
HSCs to develop leukemia, in part through a Plzf-driven self-renewal program.

Chromosomal translocations involving the MLL gene on 11q23 present frequent 
abnormalities in pediatric, adult and therapy-related acute leukemias, and are 
generally associated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis. Here, we report 
bioluminescent acute leukemia xenograft mouse models of the most frequent and 
aggressive MLL-related acute leukemias (infant and adult MLL-AF9, MLL-ENL, 
MLL-AF4). Four acute leukemia cell lines carrying MLL-related translocations 
were stably transduced with a firefly luciferase transgene and injected 
intravenously into NOD/SCID mice. Leukemia progression was monitored by in vivo 
bioluminescence imaging (BLI). All mice developed MLL-related acute leukemia. 
The four MLL-related acute leukemia models showed a different course of infant 
and adult MLL-AF9 acute myeloid leukemia, and a rapid aggressiveness of MLL-ENL 
acute lymphoblastic leukemia and MLL-AF4 acute biphenotypic leukemia. Tissue 
analysis and RT-PCR of bone marrow, spleen and liver from the mice confirmed the 
BL results. To validate BLI for the detection of a therapeutic response, 
systemic treatment with an anti-luciferase-targeting siRNA (siLuc) complexed 
with cationic nanoparticles was administered to mice with MLL-AF4 acute 
lymphoblastic leukemia. The BLI signal showed a reduction following treatment 
with siLuc compared to the control mice. These mouse models present MLL-related 
acute leukemia evolution similar to the human counterparts. Moreover, they are 
non-invasive, rapid and sensitive models, suitable for the in vivo study of 
MLL-related acute leukemias. Finally, BLI showed in vivo luminescence down 
modulation obtained by systemic treatment with luciferase-targeting siRNA 
nanoparticle complexes, confirming that these MLL-related leukemia mouse models 
are optimal for the evaluation and selection of delivery systems for siRNA and 
other new biotechnological pharmaceuticals.

Demonstration of mycobacterial antigens in leprosy tissues.

Mshana RN, Belehu A, Stoner GL, Harboe M, Haregewoin A.

Biopsies from 69 patients with leprosy were stained to demonstrate mycobacterial 
antigens using immunoperoxidase methods. The same biopsies were cut and stained 
using Fite-Faraco, TRIFF and hematoxylin-eosin for classifying the patients and 
to demonstrate mycobacteria. Since M. leprae and BCG show extensive antigenic 
cross reactions, anti-BCG antibodies were used as primary antisera to 
demonstrate cross-reacting antigens of M. leprae. Cross-reacting mycobacterial 
antigens were, thus, found in all LL and BL leprosy patients. Eight out of 10 
patients with indeterminate leprosy had mycobacterial antigens and 17 out of 19 
BT leprosy patients were positive for antigens. In general, in the BT patients 
the presence of the antigen was related to the host tissue reaction; this 
relationship was found in only half of the patients with indeterminate leprosy 
studied. During ENL mycobacterial antigens were found both intra- and 
extra-cellularly in the inflammatory infiltrate, but the polymorphonuclear 
leukocyte infiltration was seen only around the extracellular perivascular 
antigen. In reversal reaction, the inflammatory response was towards 
extracellular mycobacterial antigens. After this reaction there were no antigens 
demonstrable.

Endosulfan is an organochlorine pesticide commonly found in aquatic environments 
that has been found to reduce thermal tolerance of fish. Lipotropes such as the 
food additive, Lecithin has been shown to improve thermal tolerance in fish 
species. This study was conducted to evaluate the role of lipotropes (lecithin) 
for enhancing the thermal tolerance of Chanos chanos reared under sublethal low 
dose endosulfan-induced stress. Two hundred and twenty-five fish were 
distributed randomly into five treatments, each with three replicates. Four 
isocaloric and isonitrogenous diets were prepared with graded levels of 
lecithin: normal water and fed with control diet (En0/L0), endosulfan-treated 
water and fed with control diet (En/L0), endosulfan-treated water and fed with 
1% (En/L1%), 1.5% (En/L 1.5%) and 2% (En/L 2%) lecithin supplemented feed. The 
endosulfan in treated water was maintained at the level of 1/40th of LC50 
(0.52ppb). At the end of the five weeks, critical temperature maxima (CTmax), 
lethal temperature maxima (LTmax), critical temperature minima (CTmin) and 
lethal temperature minima (LTmin) were Determined. There was a significant 
(P<0.01) effect of dietary lecithin on temperature tolerance (CTmax, LTmax, 
CTmin and LTmin) of the groups fed with 1, 1.5 and 2% lecithin-supplemented diet 
compared to control and endosulfan-exposed groups. Positive correlations were 
observed between CT max and LTmax (R(2)=0.934) as well as between CTmin and 
LTmin (R(2)=0.9313). At the end of the thermal tolerance study, 
endosulfan-induced changes in cellular stress enzymes (Catalase, SOD and GST in 
liver and gill and neurotansmitter enzyme, brain AChE) were significantly 
(p<0.01) improved by dietary lecithin. We herein report the role of lecithin in 
enhancing the thermal tolerance and protection against cellular stress in fish 
exposed to an organochlorine pesticide.

In this study, we estimated the CD4+, CD8+, CD3+ cell counts and the CD4/CD8 
ratio among normal healthy controls (adults and children), leprosy patients 
(without any complications and during reactional states), TB patients (with and 
without HIV), and HIV-positive patients (early infection and full-blown AIDS) 
and correlated the changes with disease progression. In our study, it was 
observed that among adults, CD4+ cell counts ranged from 518-1098, CD8+ from 
312-952, whereas CD4/CD8 ratio from 0.75-2.30. Among children, both CD4+ and 
CD8+ cells were more and the CD4/CD8 ratio varied from 0.91-3.17. With regard to 
leprosy patients, we observed that CD4+ and CD8+ cell counts were lower among PB 
(pauci-bacillary) and MB (multi-bacillary) patients. CD4/CD8 ratio was 0.99 ± 
0.28 among PB patients while the ratio was lower, 0.78 ± 0.20, among MB 
patients. CD4+ cell counts were raised during RR (reversal reactions) and ENL 
(erythema nodosum leprosum) among the PB and MB patients whereas the CD8+ cell 
counts were lower among PB and MB patients. CD4/CD8 ratio doubled during 
reactional episodes of RR and ENL. Among the HIV-negative tuberculosis (TB) 
patients, both the CD4+ and CD8+ cell counts were found to be less and the 
CD4/CD8 ratio varied between 0.53-1.75. Among the HIV-positive TB patients and 
HIV-positive patients, both the CD4+ and CD8+ cells were very less and ratio 
drops significantly. In the initial stages of infection, as CD4+ counts drop, an 
increase in the CD8+ cell counts was observed and the ratio declines. In 
full-blown cases, CD4+ cell counts were very low, 3-4 to 54 cells, CD8+ cells 
from 12-211 and the ratio drops too low. This study is the first of its kind in 
this region of the country and assumes importance since no other study has 
reported the values of CD4+ and CD8+ T-lymphocyte counts among patients with 
mycobacterial diseases (leprosy and TB), HIV infections along with normal 
healthy individuals of the region, and correlation with clinical presentations 
of patients.

A patient with lepromatous leprosy, while on WHO multidrug therapy (MDT) for 
multibacillary disease, was diagnosed as having dapsone syndrome with recurrent 
episodes of bullous lesions on the lower extremities for 4-5 years. The lesions 
were associated with high-grade fever. Examination revealed multiple 
hypopigmented macules on the limbs. Multiple atrophic scars were also found on 
the buttocks and lower limbs. Bilateral ulnar, radial cutaneous and lateral 
popliteal nerves were thickened. On day 10 of WHO-MB-MDT he developed a flaccid 
bulla on the lower leg. Skin slit smear showed a bacterial index (BI) of 3+ and 
the histopathology was consistent with type II reaction. High dose 
corticosteroid therapy was started but he continued to have new lesions, and was 
therefore referred to a centre where thalidomide was available. Clinical 
response was good and he remained symptom-free after gradual reduction in 
dosage. ENL should be differentiated from bullous drug reactions, pemphigus 
vulgaris, bullous pemphigoid and other blistering diseases.

Evidence from the literature suggests that dietary flaxseed lignans have the 
ability to modulate inflammation, which is recognized as the underlying basis of 
multiple chronic human diseases in older adults. Our objective was to determine 
the effects of oral lignan supplementation on biochemical and functional 
indicators of inflammation as well as safety and tolerability in older healthy 
adults. We designed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical 
trial in older healthy adults (60-80 years) to assess flaxseed lignan-enriched 
complex (∼38% secoisolariciresinol diglucoside [SDG]; 600 mg SDG dose) oral 
supplementation effects on biochemical and functional indicators of inflammation 
and safety and tolerability in older healthy adults after 6 months of once-daily 
oral administration. The clinical trial confirmed that plasma concentration of 
total flaxseed lignans (free and conjugated forms) secoisolariciresinol (SECO), 
enterodiol (ED), and enterolactone (ENL) were significantly associated with 
daily oral supplementation of flaxseed lignan-enriched complex (p < 0.05). A 
significant decrease in systolic blood pressure (SBP; from a mean of 155 ± 13 mm 
Hg at baseline to 140 ± 11 mm Hg at 24 weeks) was observed in 
lignan-supplemented participants stratified into an SBP ≥140 mm Hg subcategory 
(p = 0.04). No differences were found between treatment or placebo groups in 
terms of cognition, pain, activity, physical measurements (calf, waist, and 
upper arm circumstances), and grip strength. With respect to blood inflammatory 
markers, lipid profiles, and biochemical parameters, no significant differences 
were found between treatment and placebo groups at the end of the 6-month 
supplementation. No adverse effects were reported during supplementation. These 
data further support the safety and tolerability of long-term flaxseed

AF4 and ENL family proteins are frequently fused with MLL, and they comprise a 
higher order complex (designated AEP) containing the P-TEFb transcription 
elongation factor. Here, we show that AEP is normally recruited to MLL-target 
chromatin to facilitate transcription. In contrast, MLL oncoproteins fused with 
AEP components constitutively form MLL/AEP hybrid complexes to cause sustained 
target gene expression, which leads to transformation of hematopoietic 
progenitors. Furthermore, MLL-AF6, an MLL fusion with a cytoplasmic protein, 
does not form such hybrid complexes, but nevertheless constitutively recruits 
AEP to target chromatin via unknown alternative mechanisms. Thus, AEP 
recruitment is an integral part of both physiological and pathological 
MLL-dependent transcriptional pathways. Bypass of its normal recruitment 
mechanisms is the strategy most frequently used by MLL oncoproteins.

Ganjam, India.

The histological findings of 22 patients with neuritis, 14 developing pain, 
tenderness and swelling during treatment and 8 during surveillance are presented 
in this study. Seven patients' biopsies showed macrophage type and 14 had 
epithelioid cell type of granulomas. All biopsies showed evidence of active 
disease, except for two patients with macrophage granulomas where some 
regressive changes were evident. One biopsy showed fibrosis with lymphocytic 
infiltration. The histology of epithelioid cell granulomas had varied 
histopathological presentations ranging from non-reacting BT to those with 
severe type I reaction with caseation necrosis, liquefaction and calcification. 
Two macrophage granulomas showed partial regression though there was neuritis 
clinically and features of ENL in the biopsy sections. One biopsy showed histoid 
changes. All the biopsies showed similar histopathological features irrespective 
of whether neuritis appeared during treatment or surveillance. The features of 
reaction were severe in nerves, probably due to the adjuvant nature of lipid and 
myelin in the nerve tissue. The histopathological features of nerve biopsies 
from patients under surveillance appeared to be ongoing active disease rather 
than relapse.

In the European Union (EU) three coloured graded Front-of-Pack labels (FoPLs), 
two endorsed by governments (Nutri-Score and Multiple Traffic Lights (MTL)) and 
one designed by industry (Evolved Nutrition Label (ENL)) are currently being 
discussed. This study aimed to investigate the impact of these FoPLs on portion 
size selection, specifically for less healthy products. In 2018, participants 
from the French NutriNet-Santé cohort study (N = 25,772) were exposed through a 
web-based self-administered questionnaire to products from three food categories 
(sweet biscuits, cheeses, and sweet spreads), with or without FoPLs, and were 
invited to select the portion they would consume (in size and number). 
Kruskall-Wallis tests, and mixed ordinal logistic regression models, were used 
to investigate the effects of FoPLs on portion size selection. Compared to no 
label, Nutri-Score consistently lowered portion sizes (OR = 0.76 (0.74⁻0.76)), 
followed by MTL (OR = 0.83 (0.82⁻0.84)). For ENL, the effects differed depending 
on the food group: It lowered portion size selection for cheeses (OR = 0.84 
(0.83⁻0.87)), and increased it for spreads (OR = 1.19 (1.15⁻1.22)). Nutri-Score 
followed by MTL appear efficient tools to encourage consumers to decrease their 
portion size for less healthy products, while ENL appears to have inconsistent 
effects depending on the food category.

Leprosy or Hansen's disease is a debilitating chronic granulomatous disease 
caused by Mycobacterium leprae, with high incidence and prevalence in Brazil. 
The -308 bp G/A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP rs1800629) in the tumor 
necrosis factor (TNF) gene promoter is a proposed risk factor for leprosy. In 
Brazil, Northern India, Egypt and Nepal, the common G allele was associated with 
leprosy. In Eastern India, Thailand and Malawi the minor A allele was the risk 
factor. Allele A was previously associated with high TNF. We genotyped rs1800629 
in 326 leprosy cases from Bahia State, Brazil, including 72 paucibacillary (PB) 
and 47 multibacillary (MB) without reactions, and 69 reversal reaction (RR) and 
78 erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) with reactions. Logistic regression was used 
to compare patient groups with 331 healthy controls. Relative TNF mRNA was 
determined in peripheral blood leukocytes by QRTPCR, and serum TNF levels 
measured by ELISA. We found that TNF mRNA expression was higher (P=0.03) in 
leprosy patients compared to endemic controls, but did not differ significantly 
between clinical subgroups. Carriage of the minor A allele was associated 
(P=0.003) with low TNF mRNA across leprosy patients. Nevertheless, we found no 
evidence for either allele at this SNP as a risk factor for leprosy per se 
(OR=1.12, 95% CI 0.79-1.60, P=0.52), PB (OR=0.99, 95% CI 0.54-1.81, P=0.97), MB 
(OR=0.86, 95% CI 0.40-1.83, P=0.70), RR (OR=1.37, 95% CI 0.79-2.38, P=0.27) or 
ENL (OR=0.76, 95% CI 0.40-1.45, P=0.42) when compared to endemic controls. 
Further studies are required to determine whether the influence of the minor A 
allele on TNF mRNA levels determines response to treatment, particularly in the 
context of ENL reaction treatment with anti-TNF therapies and RR reactions where 
treatment with prednisolone is known to reduce TNF levels. Our findings 
contribute to understanding TNF as an important determinant of leprosy 
immunopathology in Brazil.

Mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) gene rearrangements are among the most frequent 
chromosomal abnormalities in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). MLL fusion patterns 
are associated with the patient's prognosis; however, their relationship with 
driver mutations is unclear. We conducted sequence analyses of 338 genes in 
pediatric patients with MLL-rearranged (MLL-r) AML (n = 56; JPLSG AML-05 study) 
alongside data from the TARGET study's pediatric cohorts with MLL-r AML (n = 
104), non-MLL-r AML (n = 581), and adult MLL-r AML (n = 81). KRAS mutations were 
most frequent in pediatric patients with high-risk MLL fusions (MLL-MLLLT10, 
MLL-MLLT4, and MLL-MLLT1). Pediatric patients with MLL-r AML (n = 160) and a 
KRAS mutation (KRAS-MT) had a significantly worse prognosis than those without a 
KRAS mutation (KRAS-WT) (5-year event-free survival [EFS]: 51.8% vs 18.3%, P < 
.0001; 5-year overall survival [OS]: 67.3% vs 44.3%, P = .003). The adverse 
prognostic impact of KRAS mutations was confirmed in adult MLL-r AML. KRAS 
mutations were associated with adverse prognoses in pediatric patients with both 
high-risk (MLLT10+MLLT4+MLLT1; n = 60) and intermediate-to-low-risk 
(MLLT3+ELL+others; n = 100) MLL fusions. The prognosis did not differ 
significantly between patients with non-MLL-r AML with KRAS-WT or KRAS-MT. 
Multivariate analysis showed the presence of a KRAS mutation to be an 
independent prognostic factor for EFS (hazard ratio [HR], 2.21; 95% confidence 
interval [CI], 1.35-3.59; P = .002) and OS (HR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.01-3.31; P = 
.045) in MLL-r AML. The mutation is a distinct adverse prognostic factor in 
MLL-r AML, regardless of risk subgroup, and is potentially useful for accurate 
treatment stratification. This trial was registered at the UMIN (University 
Hospital Medical Information Network) Clinical Trials Registry (UMIN-CTR; 
http://www.umin.ac.jp/ctr/index.htm) as #UMIN000000511.

[Leprous neuropathy--observation from the standpoint vasculitis].

[Article in Japanese]

Nagasawa T(1).

Author information:

Pathogenesis of leprous neuropathy was studied from the standpoint of 
vasculitis. In vasculitic syndrome, mononeuritis multiplex is the most specific 
peripheral nerve injury. It occurs most frequently in small vessel vasculitis. 
Among them, the incidence is highest in microscopic polyangitis (MPO), 
Churg-Strauss Syndrome (CSS), and Wegener's granulomatosis (WG). All of them are 
categorized as ANCA associated disease. Because the disease activity is parallel 
with ANCA titer and ANCA is related directory to the pathogenesis of necrotizing 
vasculitis as well as the occurrence of peripheral neuropathy. Other small 
vessel vasculitis, such as lupus or rheumatoid vasculitis which are believed to 
occur by immune complex mechanism, are accompanied seldom by peripheral 
neuropathy. In WG, there are granulomatous lesions in upper and lower 
respiratory tracts which are supposed to be induced by Th1 dominant CD4 T cell 
infiltration. In cases of leprosy, if peripheral neuropathy were related to 
small vessel vasculitis, there might be two different pathogenesis. One is 
granulomatous vasculitis like WG in tuberculoid type. The other is immune 
complex type necrotizing vasculitis like SLE in lepromatous type, especially 
ENL. The site of these events may be small vessel in epineurium. Further 
immunologic studies are needed to clarify detailed mechanisms of leprous 
neuropathy.

A study of cell mediated immunity in leprosy.

Dubey GK, Joglekar VK, Hardas UD, Chaubey BS.

This paper presents a review of 123 cases of leprosy of different clinical types 
as regards to their status of cellular immunity. These 123 cases included 41 
fresh cases, 18 cases of reaction and 64 cases of leprosy taking antileprosy 
treatment. Out of 41 untreated cases only 11 turned up for follow up and their 
lymphoblastic transformation was repeated 4 to 6 months after initiating the 
treatment. It was observed that cell mediated immunity as expressed in terms of 
percentage of blast cells is definitely depressed in leprosy, most in LL and 
least in TT. There is a definite increase in the percentage of blast cells after 
taking antileprosy treatment. The rise in percentage of blast cells and hence 
cellular immunity is relatively more in patients treated with Lamprene as 
compared to those treated with DDS. Reactions also have impact over immunity in 
leprosy. Thus, most of the patients with ENL show higher values for blast 
percentage as compared to those with lepra reaction. It appears that serial 
lymphocyte cultures if done in all cases of leprosy undergoing treatment will 
help in assessment of individual progress.

1. The most common site of ENL is the head and neck, with Waldeyer's ring and 
specifically, the tonsil, standing as the most frequent area of involvement. 
Most patients have intermediate or high-grade histologies. 2. Patients present 
with identical signs and symptoms as squamous cell carcinoma of the head and 
neck, underscoring the importance of a thorough otolaryngological examination. 
3. Biopsy samples should be submitted as fresh and permanent samples 
specifically labeled for lymphoma evaluation. 4. A thorough and timely staging 
work-up should be conducted once a positive biopsy diagnosis is obtained. 5. 
Treatment consists of radiation and/or chemotherapy. Prognosis depends on 
histology, stage, and site of lesion. Newer treatment strategies may lead to 
improved survival for patients with head and neck NHL.

Sera from 25 patients with type 1 (Lepra), upgrading and downgrading, and type 2 
(erythema nodosum leprosum [ENL]) reactions were assayed, during the reaction 
and after its clinical remission, for changes in levels of alpha-1-antitrypsin 
(A1A) and C-reactive protein (CRP). The results were compared with those from 
normal healthy adults and patients of leprosy without history and/or clinical 
evidence of reaction. The A1A levels correlated better with changes in status of 
type 1 reaction; whereas CRP levels correlated well with alterations in type 2 
reactions and were definitely superior to A1A in this situation for monitoring 
the course of these episodes.

The feasibility and effects of a 3-year treatment using rifampicin (RFP), 
clofazimine (B663) and dapsone (DDS) in multibacillary leprosy patients in 
Yangzhou Prefecture and Dongtai County (1983-1986) are reported. Among 591 
active multibacillary leprosy patients in the two areas, 569 (96.30%) were 
treated with this regimen. Of 303 cases available for analysis, 196 (64.7%) 
cases showed negative skin smears and clinical inactivity. The rest showed 
different degrees of improvement. The average reduction of BI was 0.78. The 
intensity and frequency of ENL and neuritis decreased markedly with treatment. 
The main side-effects were pigmentation and ichthyosiform changes of the skin, 
but these did not influence treatment.

Here we present a novel method "Genomic inverse PCR for exploration of ligated 
breakpoints" (GIPFEL) that allows the sensitive detection of recurrent 
chromosomal translocations. This technique utilizes limited amounts of DNA as 
starting material and relies on PCR based quantification of unique DNA sequences 
that are created by circular ligation of restricted genomic DNA from 
translocation bearing cells. Because the complete potential breakpoint region is 
interrogated, a prior knowledge of the individual, specific interchromosomal 
fusion site is not required. We validated GIPFEL for the five most common gene 
fusions associated with childhood leukemia (MLL-AF4, MLL-AF9, MLL-ENL, 
ETV6-RUNX1, and TCF3-PBX1). A workflow of restriction digest, purification, 
ligation, removal of linear fragments and precipitation enriching for circular 
DNA was developed. GIPFEL allowed detection of translocation specific signature 
sequences down to a 10-4 dilution which is close to the theoretical limit. In a 
blinded proof-of-principle study utilizing DNA from cell lines and 144 children 
with B-precursor-ALL associated translocations this method was 100% specific 
with no false positive results. Sensitivity was 83%, 65%, and 24% for t(4;11), 
t(9;11) and t(11;19) respectively. Translocation t(12;21) was correctly detected 
in 64% and t(1;19) in 39% of the cases. In contrast to other methods, the 
characteristics of GIPFEL make it particularly attractive for prospective 
studies.

addition to daily DDS has been undertaken in order to evaluate the efficacy as 
also the potential dangers of such a regimen. Twenty untreated LL cases who were 
otherwise healthy were included in the study. Ten cases received weekly 900 mg 
Rifampicin for 6 weeks in addition to 100 mg daily DDS, while the rest were 
treated likewise but were given similar looking placebo capsules instead of RFP. 
A nine month follow-up, as also mouse foot pad results indicate that the 
efficacy of this regimen was found to be better than that with DDS alone and 
this compares favourably with trials involving 600 mg Rifampician administration 
daily. No major untoward side effects were encountered in the trial group 
thought the incidence of ENL was slightly higher in the trial group.

BACKGROUND: Extra nodal lymphoma (ENL) constitutes about 33 % of all 
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. 18-28% develops in the head and neck region. A 
multimodality treatment with multi-agent chemotherapy (CT) and radiotherapy (RT) 
is considered optimum.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrieved the treatment charts of patients of HNENL 
treated in our institute from 2001-2012. The charts were reviewed and the 
demographic, treatment details and outcome of HNENL patients were retrieved 
using predesigned pro-forma.
RESULTS: We retrieved data of 75 consecutive patients HNENL. Median age was 47 
years (Range: 8-76 years). Of the 75 patients 51 were male and 24 were female. 
55 patients were evaluable. The patient and tumor characteristics are summarized 
in Table 1. All patients were staged comprehensively with contrast enhanced 
computed tomography of head, neck, thorax, abdomen, pelvis and bone marrow 
aspiration and biopsy 66 patients received a combination multi-agent CT with 
CHOP being the commonest regimen. 42 patients received 4 or lesser number of 
cycles of chemotherapy whereas 24 received more than 4 cycles chemotherapy. Post 
radiotherapy, 41 out of 42 patients had a complete response at 3 months. Only 21 
patients had a complete response after chemotherapy. All patients received 
radiation (mostly involved field radiation) as a part of the treatment. The 
median radiation dose was 45 Gray (Range: 36 Gray-50 Gray). The radiation was 
planned by 2D fluoro simulation based technique in 37 cases and by 3 Dimensional 
conformal radiation therapy (3DCRT) in 36 cases. Two patients were planned by 
the intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) technique. IMRT was planned for 
one thyroid and one nasal cavity primary. 5 patients experienced relapse after a 
median follow up of 19 months. The median survival was not reached. The 
estimated two and three year survival were 92.9% (95%CI-68.6-95.35) and 88% 
(95%CI-60.82-92.66) respectively. Univariate analysis revealed higher stage and 
poorer baseline performance status to be significantly associated with worse 
progression free survival. 5 patients progressed (relapse or primary disease 
progression) after treatment. Of the 5 patients, two patients were primary 
orbital NHL, two patients had NHL nasal cavity and one was NHL thyroid.
CONCLUSIONS: Combined modality treatment in HNENL confers excellent disease 
control with acceptable side effects.

The HIV-1 Tat protein stimulates viral gene expression by recruiting human 
transcription elongation complexes containing P-TEFb, AFF4, ELL2, and ENL or AF9 
to the viral promoter, but the molecular organization of these complexes remains 
unknown. To establish the overall architecture of the HIV-1 Tat elongation 
complex, we mapped the binding sites that mediate complex assembly in vitro and 
in vivo. The AFF4 protein emerges as the central scaffold that recruits other 
factors through direct interactions with short hydrophobic regions along its 
structurally disordered axis. Direct binding partners CycT1, ELL2, and ENL or 
AF9 act as bridging components that link this complex to two major elongation 
factors, P-TEFb and the PAF complex. The unique scaffolding properties of AFF4 
allow dynamic and flexible assembly of multiple elongation factors and connect 
the components not only to each other but also to a larger network of 
transcriptional regulators.

[The mechanism of MLL-rearranged leukemogenesis and its targeted therapies].

[Article in Japanese]

Leukemia is caused by uncontrolled proliferation of immature hematopoietic 
progenitors. MLL fusion proteins, generated by chromosomal translocations, 
activate a broad range of previously transcribed genes to achieve the same 
expression profile as that of the parent cell in the daughter cells, thereby 
promoting self-renewal. Normally, replication of the expression profile only 
occurs in the hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). A transactivation system 
comprised of MLL and AF4/ENL/P-TEFb (AEP) complexes promotes it by reactivating 
CpG-rich promoters. In the normal hematopoietic development, this system is 
tightly regulated and progressively suppressed during the course of 
hematopoietic differentiation so that non-HSC hematopoietic cells would not 
self-renew. Genetic mutations such as fusions of MLL and AEP components generate 
a constitutively active form of the MLL transcriptional machinery, which 
aberrantly promotes self-renewal even in non-HSC hematopoietic cells. In this 
review, I depict a molecular mechanism of MLL fusion-mediated leukemogenesis 
from a standpoint that leukemogenesis is driven by aberrant self-renewal that is 
mediated by hyper-active transcriptional machinery, and introduce several 
molecularly targeted therapies in the making which specifically perturb this 
transactivation system.

TFF2 (trefoil family factor2) inhibits apoptosis in breast and colorectal cancer 
cell lines.

We have recently demonstrated that human TFF2 inhibits apoptosis in the non-TFF2 
expressing breast adenocarcinoma cell line MCF-7. In this study we examined the 
impact of TFF2 and an anti-TFF2 antibody (hSP3) on the survival of other human 
adenocarcinoma cell lines; TFF2-positive (LS174T and SW480) and TFF2-negative 
(MCF-7 and T47D). Addition of TFF2 protected the (TFF2-) lines but had no effect 
on those constitutively expressing TFF2. Blocking with hSP3 significantly 
increased apoptosis in the (TFF2+) cell lines with minimal effect on the (TFF2-) 
cells. Our results show that the cytoprotective effect of TFF2 seen in MCF-7 
cells is not cell line-specific and can be abrogated by inhibition of its 
expression.

Leprous neuropathies.

Waters MF(1), Jacobs JM.

Author information:
(1)Hospital for Tropical Diseases, London, UK.

Once a terrifying disease, leprosy today has a very hopeful prognosis, provided 
that it is diagnosed early and treated with modern multidrug chemotherapy, any 
immunological reactions being recognized quickly and controlled well to prevent 
(further) peripheral nerve damage after commencing treatment. The diagnosis 
should be considered in all patients who present with peripheral neuropathy 
and/or anaesthetic skin lesions who come from or have lived in the tropics and 
subtropics. Although M. leprae cannot yet be grown in vitro, it is readily grown 
in experimental animals. A complete gene library has been developed, much of the 
genome mapped and a number species-specific and common mycobacterial antigens 
identified. The intricacies of the host-parasite relationship, especially of 
cell-mediated immunity, and of the important immunological reactions of ENL and 
reversal reaction have been widely investigated. Modern MDT has caused a 
dramatic fall in prevalence, although the world annual case detection rate 
remains at around 600,000 new patients, many being at an early stage of the 
disease. WHO has launched a campaign to eliminate leprosy as a significant 
public health risk by the 2000 (with a prevalence of less than 1:10 000 
population), which may well be achieved in some endemic countries. Leprosy will, 
however, remain an important cause of peripheral neuropathy for at least several 
more decades.

The Na+/myo-inositol cotransporter (SMIT1) is overexpressed in human Down 
syndrome (DS) and in trisomy 16 fetal mice (Ts16), an animal model of the human 
condition. SMIT1 overexpression determines increased levels of intracellular 
myo-inositol, a precursor of phophoinositide synthesis. SMIT1 is overexpressed 
in CTb cells, an immortalized cell line established from the cerebral cortex of 
a Ts16 mouse fetus. CTb cells exhibit impaired cytosolic Ca2+ signals in 
response to glutamatergic and cholinergic stimuli (increased amplitude and 
delayed time-dependent kinetics in the decay post-stimulation), compared to our 
CNh cell line, derived from the cerebral cortex of a euploid animal. Considering 
the role of myo-inositol in intracellular signaling, we normalized SMIT1 
expression in CTb cells using specific mRNA antisenses. Forty-eight hours 
post-transfection, SMIT1 levels in CTb cells reached values comparable to those 
of CNh cells. At this time, decay kinetics of Ca2+ signals induced by either 
glutamate, nicotine, or muscarine were accelerated in transfected CTb cells, to 
values similar to those of CNh cells. The amplitude of glutamate-induced 
cytosolic Ca2+ signals in CTb cells was also normalized. The results suggest 
that SMIT1 overexpression contributes to abnormal cholinergic and glutamatergic 
Ca2+ signals in the trisomic condition, and knockdown of DS-related genes in our 
Ts16-derived cell line could constitute a relevant tool to study DS-related 
neuronal dysfunction.

Lymphadenopathy is known to be associated with lepromatous leprosy and has also 
been observed as a feature of type-2 lepra reaction. However, nodular lymph node 
enlargement is not commonly reported in leprosy patients or as a feature of 
relapse. We herewith are presenting a case of bacteriological relapse in a 
patient of lepromatous leprosy treated 22 years before till smear negativity 
with WHO multidrug therapy (MDT) multibacillary type (MB). She presented with 
prominent nodular swelling of the cervical group of lymph nodes along with 
generalized lymphadenopathy, which was mistakenly treated as tubercular 
lymphadenopathy. A diagnosis of late bacteriological relapse of lepromatous 
leprosy presenting with prominent lymphadenopathy and ENL was made after 
relevant investigations. The patient was started on treatment with WHO MDT MB 
(daily dapsone and clofazimine and monthly rifampicin) and thalidomide (200 
mg/day). Nerve pain regressed within 2 weeks of therapy. The lymph nodal 
swelling regressed within 3 months of starting treatment.

The aim of the study was to determine the age-dependence of the accommodative 
force on the lens in order to make it clear whether the causes of presbyopia are 
due to lenticular or extralenticular changes. A finite element model of the lens 
of an 11-, 29- and 45-year-old human eye was constructed to represent the fully 
accommodated state. Subsequently, the force that was needed to mould the lens 
into its unaccommodated state was calculated. The force on the lens appeared to 
be preserved with age, with only a slight increase to a value of approximately 
0.06N. In conclusion, the preservation of the net force delivered by the 
extralenticular ciliary body indicates that the causes of presbyopia must be 
ascribed to lenticular changes.

Lignans are phytochemicals studied extensively as dietary factors in chronic 
disease etiology. Our goal was to examine associations between the gut 
microbiota and lignan metabolism and whether these associations differ by 
ethnicity. We conducted a flaxseed (FS) dietary intervention in 252 healthy, 
postmenopausal women of African ancestry (AA) and European ancestry (EA). 
Participants consumed ~10 g/d ground flaxseed for 6 weeks and provided overnight 
urine collections and fecal samples before and after intervention. The gut 
microbiota was characterized using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and differences in 
microbial community composition compared by ethnicity and intervention status. 
We observed a significant difference in the composition of the microbiota 
measured as beta diversity (p < 0.05) between AA and EA at baseline that was 
attenuated with FS consumption. Genera that were significantly associated with 
ENL production (e.g., Klebsiella, Lactobacillus, Slackia, Senegalimassilia) were 
unique to each group. Bacteria (e.g., Fusobacteria, Pyramidobacter and 
Odoribacter) previously associated with colorectal cancer and cardiovascular 
disease, both diet-related chronic diseases, were unique to either AA or EA and 
were significantly reduced in the FS intervention. This study suggests that 
ethnic variation in ENL metabolism may be linked to gut microbiota composition, 
and its impact on disease risk deserves future investigation.

OBJECTIVE: To analyze the diagnostic value of multiple reverse 
transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for detecting different fusion 
genes in children with primary acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).
METHODS: The clinical data of 80 children with ALL treated in the 2nd affiliated 
hospital of Xi'an Medical College from September 2012 to September 2017 were 
collected and retrospectively analyzed. Immunophenotype, chromosome karyotype 
and fusion gene were analyzed.
RESULTS: Immunophenotyping showed that there were 2 cases of mixed expression of 
myeloid + B system, 2 cases with pre- B expression, 58 cases with former B 
expression, 11 cases with CD13 combined with pre- B expression, 4 cases with CD5 
combined with pre- B expression, and 3 cases with CD2 combined with pre- B 
expression. The results of chromosome karyotype analysis showed that among 72 
cases of karyotype analysts 5 cases could not be analyzed, 27 cases were 
determined to be normal karyotype, 11 cases with abnormal karyotype and 29 cases 
without mitotic phase. Six fusion genes were expressed in 30 cases (37.50%) of 
80 ALL children, including MLL/AF9, CBF/MYH 11, BCR/ABL, TLS/ERG, MLL/ENL and 
TEL/AML1. Among the 3 cases with MLL/AF9 fusion gene expression [t(9;11)], 2 
cases showed a poor response to early treatment, but achieved complete remission 
after intensive chemotherapy, and 1 case accepted bone marrow transplantation; 
in 1 case with CBF/MYH 11 fusion gene expression, treatment was abandoned by 
family members, and 4 cases with BCR/ABL fusion gene expression [t (9;22) (q34; 
q11)] were all showed poor response to early treatment, and achieved complete 
remission after intensive chemotherapy. All the fusion genes were positive 
during remission, including 2 cases of bone marrow transplantation; 1 case with 
TLS/ERG fusion gene expression [t (16;21)] displayed poor response to early 
treatment, and completely remitted after intensive chemotherapy; 2 cases with 
MLL/ENL fusion gene expression [t (11;19)] recurred during chemotherapy; 19 
cases with TEL/AML1 fusion gene expression [t (12;21)] also achieved complete 
remission. 4 cases achieved a partial remission.
CONCLUSION: Genotyping can make up for the insufficiency of MICM typing, and 
multiplex RT-PCR can be used to rapidly detect the fusion genes caused by 
chromosomal aberration in children with ALL.

Inhibition of histone methyltransferase EZH2 depletes leukemia stem cell of 
mixed lineage leukemia fusion leukemia through upregulation of p16.

Leukemia stem cells (LSC) are resistant to conventional chemotherapy and 
persistent LSC after chemotherapy are supposed to be a major cause of relapse. 
However, information on genetic or epigenetic regulation of stem cell properties 
is still limited and LSC-targeted drugs have scarcely been identified. 
Epigenetic regulators are associated with many cellular processes including 
maintenance of stem cells. Of note are polycomb group proteins, because they 
potentially control stemness, and can be pharmacologically targeted by a 
selective inhibitor (DZNep). Therefore, we investigated the therapeutic 
potential of EZH2 inhibition in mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) fusion leukemia. 
Intriguingly, EZH2 inhibition by DZNep or shRNA not only suppressed MLL fusion 
leukemia proliferation but also reduced leukemia initiating cells (LIC) 
frequency. Expression analysis suggested that p16 upregulation was responsible 
for LICs reduction. Knockdown of p16 canceled the survival advantage of mice 
treated with DZNep. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that EZH2 
was highly enriched around the transcription-start-site of p16, together with 
H3K27 methylation marks in MLL/ENL and Hoxa9/Meis1 transduced cells but not in 
E2A/HLF transduced cells. Although high expression of Hoxa9 in MLL fusion 
leukemia is supposed to be responsible for the recruitment of EZH2, our data 
also suggest that there may be some other mechanisms independent of Hoxa9 
activation to suppress p16 expression, because expression levels of Hoxa9 and 
p16 were not inversely related between MLL/ENL and Hoxa9/Meis1 transduced cells. 
In summary, our findings show that EZH2 is a potential therapeutic target of MLL 
fusion leukemia stem cells.

Do non-genomically encoded fusion transcripts cause recurrent chromosomal 
translocations?

We among others have recently demonstrated that normal cells produce "fusion 
mRNAs". These fusion mRNAs do not derive from rearranged genomic loci, but 
rather they are derived from "early-terminated transcripts" (ETTs). Premature 
transcriptional termination takes place in intronic sequences that belong to 
"breakpoint cluster regions". One important property of ETTs is that they 
exhibit an unsaturated splice donor site. This results in: (1) splicing to 
"cryptic exons" present in the final intron; (2) Splicing to another transcript 
of the same gene (intragenic trans-splicing), resulting in "exon repetitions"; 
(3) splicing to a transcript of another gene (intergenic trans-splicing), 
leading to "non-genomically encoded fusion transcripts" (NGEFTs). These NGEFTs 
bear the potential risk to influence DNA repair processes, since they share 
identical nucleotides with their DNA of origin, and thus, could be used as 
"guidance RNA" for DNA repair processes. Here, we present experimental data 
about four other genes. Three of them are associated with hemato-malignancies 
(ETV6, NUP98 and RUNX1), while one is associated with solid tumors (EWSR1). Our 
results demonstrate that all genes investigated so far (MLL, AF4, AF9, ENL, ELL, 
ETV6, NUP98, RUNX1 and EWSR1) display ETTs and produce transpliced mRNA species, 
indicating that this is a genuine property of translocating genes.

This paper investigates spatio-temporal variability during the production of the 
lingual consonants /t, k, s, x, n, l, 50% shaded block/ by four Greek speakers 
with profound hearing impairment and with differences in the intelligibility of 
their speech. It examines important factors that have been documented to 
influence intelligibility, i.e. durational variability, articulatory 
(token-to-token) variability, and coarticulatory patterns. The technique of 
electropalatography was used to record tongue-palate contact patterns during 
consonant production in order to examine differences in articulatory variability 
among speakers and in V-to-C coarticulatory effects. The study reports 
durational differences in consonant production between speakers with hearing 
impairment and normal hearing and investigates the relationship between 
token-to-token variability in tongue-palate contact patterns and duration. The 
results indicate a negative relationship between duration and variability, i.e. 
as segmental duration decreases there is an increase in variability in 
tongue-palate contact patterns. Significant speaker-dependent differences in 
duration, articulatory variability and coarticulatory patterns are reported and 
are discussed in relation to differences in intelligibility among the speakers 
with hearing impairment.

The proto-oncogene EVI1 (ecotropic viral integration site-1), located on 
chromosome band 3q26, is aberrantly expressed in human acute myeloid leukemia 
(AML) with 3q26 rearrangements. In the current study, we showed, in a large AML 
cohort carrying 11q23 translocations, that ∼ 43% of all mixed lineage leukemia 
(MLL)-rearranged leukemias are EVI1(pos). High EVI1 expression occurs in AMLs 
expressing the MLL-AF6, -AF9, -AF10, -ENL, or -ELL fusion genes. In addition, we 
present evidence that EVI1(pos) MLL-rearranged AMLs differ molecularly, 
morphologically, and immunophenotypically from EVI1(neg) MLL-rearranged 
leukemias. In mouse bone marrow cells transduced with MLL-AF9, we show that 
MLL-AF9 fusion protein maintains Evi1 expression on transformation of Evi1(pos) 
HSCs. MLL-AF9 does not activate Evi1 expression in MLL-AF9-transformed 
granulocyte macrophage progenitors (GMPs) that were initially Evi1(neg). 
Moreover, shRNA-mediated knockdown of Evi1 in an Evi1(pos) MLL-AF9 mouse model 
inhibits leukemia growth both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that Evi1 
provides a growth-promoting signal. Using the Evi1(pos) MLL-AF9 mouse leukemia 
model, we demonstrate increased sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents on 
reduction of Evi1 expression. We conclude that EVI1 is a critical player in 
tumor growth in a subset of MLL-rearranged AMLs.

Deregulation of the epigenome is an important pathogenetic mechanism in acute 
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with lysine (K)-specific methyltransferase 2A 
rearrangement (KMT2Ar). We performed array-based DNA methylation profiling of 
KMT2Ar ALL cells from 26 children in comparison to normal B-cell precursors. 
Significant changes in DNA methylation in KMT2Ar ALL were identified in 2,545 
CpG loci, influenced by age and the translocation partners AFF1 and MLLT1. In 
KMT2Ar ALL, DNA methylation loss was enriched at enhancers and for certain 
transcription factor binding sites such as BCL11A, EBF, and MEF2A. In summary, 
DNA methylation changes in KMT2Ar ALL target enhancers, genes involved in 
leukemogenesis and normal hematopoiesis, as well as transcription factor 
networks.

Transcriptional inhibition of p53 by the MLL/MEN chimeric protein found in 
myeloid leukemia.

The t(11;19)(q23;p13.1) translocation is frequently found in adult myeloid 
leukemia. In the MLL/MEN fusion protein generated by this translocation, most of 
the coding region of the MEN protein, an RNA polymerase II elongation factor, is 
fused to the N-terminal third of the MLL protein, a possible transcriptional 
regulator. However, the molecular mechanism of leukemogenesis by the fusion 
protein remains unclear. We investigated the effects of the fusion protein on 
p53 function using luciferase assays. Overexpression of the fusion protein 
suppressed the transactivation ability of p53. This negative effect of the 
fusion protein on p53 function was dependent on the region derived from MEN. 
Moreover, p53 coimmunoprecipitated with MLL/MEN as well as MEN, suggesting that 
the fusion protein binds to p53 through the MEN region. We found that MEN 
binding to p53 was mediated by its N-terminal region and repression of p53 
transcriptional activity was mediated by its C-terminal region. We also found 
that these two functional regions were essential for the transformation of Rat1 
cells mediated by MEN. Although we could not demonstrate a functional difference 
between MLL/MEN and MEN in this study, these data suggest that the MLL/MEN 
chimeric transcriptional regulator may exert its oncogenic activity by 
inhibiting the function of the p53 tumor-suppressor protein by binding to it. 
Our findings provide a novel insight into the leukemogenic mechanism exerted by 
the t(11;19)(q23;p13.1) translocation.

Partial tandem duplications of the MLL gene are detectable in peripheral blood 
and bone marrow of nearly all healthy donors.

Germany.

Partial tandem duplication within the MLL gene has recently been described as a 
novel genetic alteration in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). It has been associated 
with trisomy of chromosome 11, but was also identified in AML patients with 
normal karyotypes. The current study was performed to investigate whether MLL 
duplications are restricted to AML, and hence whether they may also occur in 
normal hematopoietic cells. MLL-duplication transcripts were analyzed by nested 
reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in peripheral blood in 
two groups of 45 and 20 patients, respectively, as well as in two bone marrow 
samples from healthy volunteers. Duplications were detected in two independent 
nested RT-PCR experiments in the peripheral blood samples of 38 of 45 (84%) and 
20 of 20 (100%) of the two groups and in both bone marrow samples. On this 
basis, MLL duplications seem to occur frequently in a subset of cells in normal 
hematopoiesis. The type of partially duplicated MLL transcripts varied 
substantially. Three transcripts were identical to those known from AML. In 
addition, four new transcripts were characterized. Three of these four were in 
frame and potentially translatable. MLL duplications were also detected by 
seminested genomic PCR with intron 9- and intron 1-specific primers in 20 of 20 
peripheral blood samples studied, indicating that the duplications are 
genomically fixed at the DNA level and are not an RT-PCR artifact. In summary, 
MLL duplications are regularly generated by homologous ALU recombination in a 
small number of hematopoietic cells of most or even all healthy donors. These 
data suggest that MLL duplications are not implicated in the malignant 
transformation in AML, or alternatively, that only a few cells will acquire 
additional oncogenic mutations necessary to establish the malignant phenotype of 
AML.

Identification of chromosome rearrangements is of importance for exact 
diagnosis, risk assessment, and therapy in blood malignancies. A new method was 
proposed for rapid and accurate identification of leukemia forms caused by 
chromosome rearrangements involving MLL (11q23). The method combines reverse 
transcription-multiplex PCR and hybridization with an oligonucleotide 
microarray. The microarray was designed to detect the five most common MLL 
rearrangements: t(4;11) MLL/AF4, t(9;11) MLL/AF9, t(11;19) MLL/ELL, t(11;19) 
MLL/ENL, and dup(11) MLL/MLL. With clinical specimens, the method was shown to 
efficiently identify the chromosome translocations in leukemia patients.

The increasing number of chromosomal rearrangements involving the human MLL 
gene, in combination with differences in clinical behavior and outcome for 
MLL-rearranged leukemia patients, makes it necessary to reflect on the cancer 
mechanism and to discuss potential therapeutic strategies. To date, 64 different 
translocations have been identified at the molecular level. With very few 
exceptions, most of the identified fusion partner genes encode proteins that 
display no homologies or functional equivalence. Only the most frequent fusion 
partners (AF4 family members, AF9, ENL, AF10 and ELL) are involved in the 
positive transcription elongation factor b-dependent activation cycle of RNA 
polymerase II. Biological functions remain to be elucidated for the other fusion 
partners. This minireview tries to sum up some of the available data and 
mechanisms identified in leukemic stem and leukemic tumor cells and link this 
information with the known functions of mixed lineage leukemia and certain mixed 
lineage leukemia fusion partners.

OBJECTIVE: To analyze the fusion genes derived from 29 types of chromosome 
structural aberrations in children with leukemia.
METHODS: Bone marrow samples from 191 children with leukemia were analyzed with 
a novel multiplex nested RT-PCR.
RESULTS: Of the 191 leukemic samples, 86 (45.0%) carried 14 types of fusion 
genes including SIL/TAL1, MLL/AF1q, E2A/PBX1, MLL/AF6, AML1/ETO, MLL/AF9, 
TEL/ABL, BCR/ABL, MLL/AF10, dupMLL, MLL/ENL, TEL/AML1, PML/RARalpha and 
CBFbeta/MYH11. The activation of oncogene HOX11 was detected in 31 cases, with 
or without other chromosome aberrations in 15 (7.8%) and 16 cases (8.4%), 
respectively.
CONCLUSION: This multiplex nested RT-PCR reaction could screen 29 types of 
chromosome structural aberrations at the same time. It may be helpful for the 
detection of minimal residual diseases after chemotherapy and bone marrow 
transplantation.

Non-specific enhancement of ethanol-induced taste aversion by naloxone.

Miceli D, Marfaing-Jallat P, Le Magnen J.

The conditioned taste aversion paradigm (CTA) was used to examine the effects of 
naloxone on ethanol-induced aversion towards a saccharine solution (3 
conditioning and 11 extinction trials). Six groups of rats received conditioning 
trials consisting of two IP injections after saccharine presentation of 
different combinations of either ethanol (E: 1.75 g/kg), LiCl (L: 12 mEq/kg, 0.1 
M), naloxone (N: 10 mg/kg) or saline (S); S-S, S-N, E-S, E-N, L-S and L-N. 
Naloxone by itself produced no aversion to the saccharin flavor. Based on the 
onset and extinction of aversion, naloxone significantly enhanced ethanol but 
also LiCl-induced CTA. The comparative data argues in favor of different 
mechanisms of action (1) between the aversive central effects of ethanol and 
morphine and (2) between ethanol's acute behavioral effects and negatively 
reinforcing properties. Enhancement of ethanol and LiCl-induced CTA by naloxone 
is compatible with hypernociceptive action of the opiate-antagonist and with the 
pain-modulating role of opiates in the CNS.

The pharmacological induction of apoptosis in neoplastic B cells presents a 
promising therapeutic avenue for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia 
(CLL). We profiled a panel of clinical multi-kinase inhibitors for their ability 
to induce apoptosis in primary CLL cells. Whereas inhibitors targeting a large 
number of receptor and intracellular tyrosine kinases including c-KIT, FLT3, BTK 
and SYK were comparatively inactive, the CDK inhibitors BMS-387032 and 
flavopiridol showed marked efficacy similar to staurosporine. Using the 
kinobeads proteomics method, kinase expression profiles and binding profiles of 
the inhibitors to target protein complexes were quantitatively monitored in CLL 
cells. The targets most potently affected were CDK9, cyclin T1, AFF3/4 and 
MLLT1, which may represent four subunits of a deregulated positive 
transcriptional elongation factor (p-TEFb) complex. Albeit with lower potency, 
both drugs also bound the basal transcription factor BTF2/TFIIH containing CDK7. 
Staurosporine and geldanamycin do not affect these targets and thus seem to 
exhibit a different mechanism of action. The data support a critical role of 
p-TEFb inhibitors in CLL that supports their future clinical development.

PURPOSE: Mismatch repair (MMR) proficiency has been reported to either increase 
or decrease radioenhancement by 24-h incubations with gemcitabine. This study 
aimed to establish the importance of MMR for radioenhancement by gemcitabine 
after short-exposure, high-dose treatment and long-exposure, low-dose treatment.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Survival of MMR-deficient HCT116 and MMR-proficient 
HCT116 + 3 cells was analyzed by clonogenic assays. Mild, equitoxic gemcitabine 
treatments (4 h, 0.1 microM vs. 24 h, 6 nM) were combined with gamma-irradiation 
to determine the radioenhancement with or without recovery. Gemcitabine 
metabolism and cell-cycle effects were evaluated by high-performance liquid 
chromatography analysis and bivariate flow cytometry.
RESULTS: Radioenhancement after 4 h of 0.1 microM of gemcitabine was similar in 
both cell lines, but the radioenhancement after 24 h of 6 nM of gemcitabine was 
reduced in MMR-proficient cells. No significant differences between both cell 
lines were observed in the gemcitabine metabolism or cell-cycle effects after 
these treatments. Gemcitabine radioenhancement after recovery was also lower in 
MMR-proficient cells than in MMR-deficient cells.
CONCLUSION: Mismatch repair proficiency decreases radioenhancement by long 
incubations of gemcitabine but does not affect radioenhancement by short 
exposures to a clinically relevant gemcitabine dose. Our data suggest that MMR 
contributes to the recovery from gemcitabine treatment.

Twenty-eight Albanian-Greek bilingual children with Developmental Language 
Disorder and 28 children with Autism Spectrum Disorder but no language 
impairment, along with 28 typically-developing, age-, Performance IQ- and 
socioeconomic status-matched bilingual children were asked to produce two 
expository texts which were coded for spelling (phonological, grammatical, 
orthographic) errors, stress and punctuation use. The children's expressive 
vocabulary, current language use and home language history were also measured. 
The results show that the bilingual children with Developmental Language 
Disorder were particularly vulnerable to spelling errors, while their bilingual 
peers with Autism Spectrum Disorder were rather challenged by stress and 
punctuation. The evidence speaks in favor of distinct patterns of writing 
impairment across the bilingual children with Developmental Language Disorder 
and Autism Spectrum Disorder.

Contrast enhancement and speckle suppression in OCT images based on a selective 
weighted variational enhancement model and an SP-FOOPDE algorithm.

Chen L, Tang C, Huang ZH, Xu M, Lei Z.

Simultaneous contrast enhancement and speckle suppression in optical coherence 
tomography (OCT) are of great significance to medical diagnosis. In this paper, 
we propose a selective weighted variational enhancement (SWVE) model to enhance 
the structural parts of OCT images, and then present a shape-preserving 
fourth-order-oriented partial differential equations (SP-FOOPDE) algorithm to 
suppress speckle noise. To be specific, in the SWVE model, we first introduce 
the fast and robust fuzzy c-means clustering (FRFCM) algorithm to generate masks 
based on the gray-level histograms of the reconstructed OCT images and utilize 
the masks to distinguish the structural parts from the background. Then the 
retinex-based weighted variational model, combined with gamma correction, is 
adopted to enhance the structural parts by multiplying the estimated reflectance 
with the adjusted illumination. In the despeckling process, we present an 
SP-FOOPDE algorithm with the fidelity term modified by the shearlet transform to 
strike a splendid balance between noise suppression and structural preservation. 
Experimental results show that the proposed method performs well in contrast 
enhancement and speckle suppression, with better quality metrics of the MSE, 
PSNR, CNR, ENL, EKI, and ν and better noise immunity than the related method. 
Moreover, the application to the segmentation preprocessing exhibits that the 
retinal structure of the OCT images processed by the proposed method can be 
completely segmented.

The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the cytogenetic findings in 
1,057 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) referred to the 
cytogenetics laboratory at the Hospital de Pediatría Dr. Juan P. Garrahan, 
between 1991 and 2014. Chromosomal abnormalities were evaluated by G-banding and 
FISH. Since December 2002, RT-PCR determinations were systematically carried out 
for BCR-ABL1, KMT2A-AFF1, ETV6-RUNX1, and TCF3-PBX1 rearrangements in children, 
adding KMT2A-MLLT3 and KMT2A-MLLT1 in infants. The percentage of abnormalities 
detected by cytogenetics was 70.1%. Four novel abnormalities, t(2;8)(p11.2;p22), 
inv(4)(p16q25), t(1;7)(q25;q32), and t(5;6)(q21;q21), were found in this cohort. 
We compared cytogenetic and RT-PCR results for BCR-ABL1, KMT2A-AFF1 and 
TCF3-PBX1 rearrangements in 497 children evaluated by both methods. The results 
were highly concordant (p < 0.7), and interestingly, FISH was relevant to 
confirm G-banding findings that were discordant with RT-PCR studies. This study 
showed the importance of performing G-banding, FISH and RT-PCR simultaneously to 
improve the detection of chromosomal abnormalities considering their important 
value in the diagnosis and prognosis of childhood ALL patients. Finally, to the 
best of our knowledge, this is the first series of cytogenetic findings in 
children with ALL reported in Argentina.

The epidemiology of reactions and nerve damage.

Saunderson P(1).

Author information:
(1)American Leprosy Mission, Greenville, South Carolina, USA.

The ALERT MDT Field Evaluation Study (AMFES) in Ethiopia, which was begun in 
1988, involves the follow-up of 594 new patients for as long as 10 years after 
completion of treatment, including 6-monthly assessments of nerve function. In 
contrast to similar studies in India and Bangladesh, the Ethiopian cohort 
presented late, had a high rate of disability at diagnosis (55%), a high rate of 
multibacillary disease (51%) and a high rate of subsequent neuropathy (43%). 
Preliminary findings include the following. One-third of the patients never 
exhibited nerve damage. True acute neuropathy has a very good prognosis when 
treated with a standard course of steroids; full recovery was observed in 88% of 
nerves. Chronic and recurrent neuropathy have a worse prognosis; these problems 
need to be identified early and managed appropriately, employing either new 
steroid regimens or new drugs. The risk factors identified in this study 
include, for neuropathy, older age, delay of diagnosis, thickened nerves at 
diagnosis, and reversal reactions. Risk factors for chronic or recurrent 
neuropathy include classification, impairment at diagnosis, and reversal and ENL 
reactions. Those factors associated with a poor outcome include impairment at 
diagnosis, and chronic or recurrent neuropathy. Various problems faced in 
research in the area of leprosy reactions and neuropathy are discussed, as are 
the priorities for research in the future.

The effect of HIV status on the clinical picture of leprosy: a prospective study 
in Ethiopia.

(1)ALERT, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.

No major interaction between HIV infection and leprosy has been documented. The 
ALERT MDT Field Evaluation Study (AMFES) has allowed the examination of possible 
interactions in a prospective manner, although the total number of HIV-positive 
individuals was not high at 22 (3.8%) of 581 patients tested. There was an 
excess number of deaths in the HIV-positive group: 27% compared with 5.7% in the 
HIV-negative group, although the causes of death were not recorded (relative 
risk 4.8; 95% CI 2.2-10.2). HIV-positive individuals had a higher risk of ENL 
reactions (relative risk 5.2; 95% CI 1.7-15.9). Reversal reactions and neuritis 
(both acute and chronic) were not significantly influenced by HIV status, 
although there was a possible increase in recurrent reversal reactions in 
HIV-positive cases (relative risk 2.2; 95% CI 0.98-4.7). There was no evidence 
to suggest an increased risk of developing leprosy or of developing 
multibacillary rather than paucibacillary disease. There was no association 
between HIV positivity and the development of impairment.

Nerve in reversal reaction.

Job CK(1).

Author information:

1. Much of the nerve destruction in leprosy takes place during the reactive 
phase, both during ENL reaction and RR. 2. The high risk patients expected to 
develop RR are borderline patients with generalized lesions (more than 10 skin 
lesions) and those presenting with three or more thickened nerve trunks. 3. In 
RR there is a sudden enhancement of already existing DTH to M. leprae and its 
antigens resulting in the release of excessive quantities of TNF alpha, INF 
gamma, and IL-2. The triggering mechanisms of this phenomenon is poorly 
understood. 4. The already existing granulomas suddenly increase considerably in 
size due to oedema and rapid influx of lymphocytes, Langhan's and foreign body 
giant cells. Fragments of M. leprae are also present in the granuloma of some 
patients. 5. In RR, the acute granulomatous inflammation can produce destruction 
of nerves even to the extent of causing caseous necrosis of the nerve tissue and 
irreversible paralysis. The swelling of the nerves due to sudden increase in 
inflammatory cells and oedema within an unyielding perineurium produce ischaemia 
and transient paralysis. 6. With prompt administration of anti-inflammatory 
drugs, paralysis recovers quickly, if it is of ischaemic origin; but will not 
recover if the Schwann cells and other nerve tissues are destroyed as a result 
of the immune granuloma. 7. A course of corticosteroids for six months along 
with anti-leprosy therapy is suggested in high risk patients as a preventive 
measure. 8. Further the serious problem of continuing nerve damage after 
clinical cure should be urgently tackled.

Modeling chromosomal translocations using conditional alleles to recapitulate 
initiating events in human leukemias.

Recurrent reciprocal chromosomal translocations are present in more than 50% of 
leukemias. A deeper understanding of how they affect cancer initiation is 
essential for evaluating the origins of cancer and the potential for therapy 
based on the translocation products. Mouse models of chromosomal translocations 
are required for this. Here we summarize three methodologies developed in our 
laboratory to model chromosomal translocations (knock-in, translocator, and 
invertor methods). We have used these models to study leukemias caused by 
fusions of the mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene and the Ews-ERG fusion gene to 
evaluate oncogenicity and elucidate some general principles about translocation 
products. We show that MLL fusions have the capacity to cause hematopoietic 
tumors only if expressed in permissive cells and that the Mll-Enl fusion can 
cause lineage reassignment if the chromosomal translocation occurs in lineage 
noncommitted progenitors. The leukemia-initiating cells generated by Mll fusions 
or by Ews-ERG fusion can be committed cells within the hematopoietic pathway. 
Our translocation mimic models are applicable to any human reciprocal 
chromosomal translocation.

Experimental and theoretical analysis of wavelet-based denoising filter for 
echocardiographic images.

Kang SC(1), Hong SH.

(1)INCOM I &C, R&D Center, Seoul, 135-280, Korea. rosette2@chollian.net

One of the most significant features of diagnostic echocardiographic images is 
to reduce speckle noise and make better image quality. In this paper we proposed 
a simple and effective filter design for image denoising and contrast 
enhancement based on multiscale wavelet denoising method. Wavelet threshold 
algorithms replace wavelet coefficients with small magnitude by zero and keep or 
shrink the other coefficients. This is basically a local procedure, since 
wavelet coefficients characterize the local regularity of a function. After we 
estimate distribution of noise within echocardiographic image, then apply to 
fitness Wavelet threshold algorithm. A common way of the estimating the speckle 
noise level in coherent imaging is to calculate the mean-to-standard-deviation 
ratio of the pixel intensity, often termed the Equivalent Number of Looks(ENL), 
over a uniform image area. Unfortunately, we found this measure not very robust 
mainly because of the difficulty to identify a uniform area in a real image. For 
this reason, we will only use here the S/MSE ratio and which corresponds to the 
standard SNR in case of additivie noise. We have simulated some 
echocardiographic images by specialized hardware for real-time 
application;processing of a 512*512 images takes about 1 min. Our experiments 
show that the optimal threshold level depends on the spectral content of the 
image. High spectral content tends to over-estimate the noise standard deviation 
estimation performed at the finest level of the DWT. As a result, a lower 
threshold parameter is required to get the optimal S/MSE. The standard WCS 
theory predicts a threshold that depends on the number of signal samples only.

Getting a HLA-matched donor is a key factor for successful hematopoietic stem 
cell transplantation. People are almost semi-matched with their parents, while a 
person HLA-matched with his/her father or mother was rarely seen, if so, usually 
whose father and mother are genetically related. HLA-low resolution for patients 
and their relatives were performed using PCR-SSP technique and three patients 
were found HLA-matched with their father in these results. One of them accepted 
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation using his HLA-matched father as his 
donor. The results showed that the chimerism was detected as stable complete 
donor chimerism, fusing gene of MLL-ENL was detected all negatively in the 
post-transplant period. This case got well hematopoietic reconstruction and GVHD 
didn't occur, so far he has survived for two years in health conditioning. It is 
concluded that people HLA-matched with his/her father or mother can be found 
when there is one identical haplotype of high frequency and strong linkage 
disequilibrium between father and mother. This case is valuable for 
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation development.

Anticancer activity of nucleoside analogues: a density functional theory based 
QSAR study.

Author information:
(1)Department of Chemical Sciences, Tezpur University, Napaam, Tezpur, 784028, 
Assam, India.

In the present work multiple linear regression analyses were performed to build 
QSAR models for nucleoside analogous using density functional theory (DFT) and 
molecular mechanics (MM+) based descriptors in both gas and solvent phases. The 
QSAR models for 14 carbocyclic analogues of nucleosides against murine leukemia 
cell line (L1210/0) and human T-lymphocyte cell lines (Molt4/C8 and CEM/0) 
explain more than 90% of the variances in the activity data along with higher 
values of [Formula: see text]. The energy of the next lowest unoccupied 
molecular orbital (E(NL)), electrophilicity (omega) and van der Waals surface 
area (SA) are the main independent factors contributing to the anticancer 
activity of nucleoside analogues. Inclusion of solvent medium increases the 
correlation of each descriptor with activity. Based on the key features 
responsible for anticancer activity, 10 new compounds with rather high 
anticancer activity have been theoretically designed. Cytotoxic activities of an 
additional set of 20 nucleoside analogues were also modeled by the same 
descriptors and found their predicted values to be in good agreement with the 
experimental values.

Hypomethylation and expression of BEX2, IGSF4 and TIMP3 indicative of MLL 
translocations in acute myeloid leukemia.

BACKGROUND: Translocations of the Mixed Lineage Leukemia (MLL) gene occur in a 
subset (5%) of acute myeloid leukemias (AML), and in mixed phenotype acute 
leukemias in infancy - a disease with extremely poor prognosis. Animal model 
systems show that MLL gain of function mutations may contribute to 
leukemogenesis. Wild-type (wt) MLL possesses histone methyltransferase activity 
and functions at the level of chromatin organization by affecting the expression 
of specific target genes. While numerous MLL fusion proteins exert a diverse 
array of functions, they ultimately serve to induce transcription of specific 
genes. Hence, acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL) with MLL mutations (MLLmu) 
exhibit characteristic gene expression profiles including high-level expression 
of HOXA cluster genes. Here, we aimed to relate MLL mutational status and tumor 
suppressor gene (TSG) methylation/expression in acute leukemia cell lines.
RESULTS: Using MS-MLPA (methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe 
amplification assay), methylation of 24 different TSG was analyzed in 28 MLLmu 
and MLLwt acute leukemia cell lines. On average, 1.8/24 TSG were methylated in 
MLLmu AML cells, while 6.2/24 TSG were methylated in MLLwt AML cells. 
Hypomethylation and expression of the TSG BEX2, IGSF4 and TIMP3 turned out to be 
characteristic of MLLmu AML cell lines. MLLwt AML cell lines displayed 
hypermethylated TSG promoters resulting in transcriptional silencing. 
Demethylating agents and inhibitors of histone deacetylases restored expression 
of BEX2, IGSF4 and TIMP3, confirming epigenetic silencing of these genes in 
MLLwt cells. The positive correlation between MLL translocation, TSG 
hypomethylation and expression suggested that MLL fusion proteins were 
responsible for dysregulation of TSG expression in MLLmu cells. This concept was 
supported by our observation that Bex2 mRNA levels in MLL-ENL transgenic mouse 
cell lines required expression of the MLL fusion gene.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the conspicuous expression of the TSG 
BEX2, IGSF4 and TIMP3 in MLLmu AML cell lines is the consequence of altered 
epigenetic properties of MLL fusion proteins.

Infant acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) comprises 2.5%-5% of pediatric ALL 
with inferior survival compared to older children. A majority of infants (80%) 
with ALL harbor KMT2A gene rearrangement, which portends a poor prognosis. 
Approximately 94 different partner genes have been identified to date. The 
common rearrangements include t(4;11)(q21;q23)KMT2A-AFF1,t(11;19) 
(q23;p13.3)KMT2A-MLLT1 and t(9;11)(p22;q23)KMT2A-MLLT3. We report a novel 
translocation t(5;11)(q35;q23)KMT2A-MAML1 in newly diagnosed infant precursor 
B-ALL. Long-term follow-up and a larger number of patients are needed to better 
understand its prognostic significance.

Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) enhances transcriptional co-activation activity 
of BAM11, a Btk-associated molecule of a subunit of SWI/SNF complexes.

Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) is required for B cell development and signal 
transduction through cell-surface molecules such as BCR and IL-5 receptor. We 
have identified a Btk-associated molecule, BAM11 (hereafter referred to as BAM) 
that binds to the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of Btk, and inhibits Btk 
activity both in vivo and in vitro. In this study, we demonstrate BAM's 
transcriptional co-activation activity and its functional interaction with Btk. 
By using transient transcription assays, we demonstrate that the enforced 
expression of BAM enhances transcriptional activity of the synthetic reporter 
gene. The C-terminus of BAM is essential for the transcriptional co-activation 
activity. The ectopic expression of Btk together with BAM enhances BAM's 
transcriptional co-activation activity. BAM's transcriptional co-activation 
activity is enhanced through interaction with Btk, and requires both its intact 
PH domain and functional kinase activity. We also show that enforced expression 
of TFII-I, another Btk-binding protein with transcriptional activity, together 
with BAM and Btk, further augments BAM- and Btk-dependent transcriptional 
co-activation. Furthermore, BAM can be co-immunoprecipitated with the INI1/SNF5 
protein, a member of the SWI/SNF complex that remodels chromatin and activates 
transcription. We propose a model in which Btk regulates gene transcription in B 
cells by activating BAM and the SWI/SNF transcriptional complex via TFII-I 
activation.

More than 20 different partner genes with MLL have been cloned from leukemia 
cells with translocations involving chromosome 11 band q23 (11q23). All reported 
partner genes fused in-frame to MLL and the fusion cDNA encode chimeric MLL 
proteins with a significant portion derived from the partner genes. We analyzed 
one patient with de novo acute monoblastic leukemia with t(11;14)(q23;q24) and 
identified that a human homologue of gephyrin (human gephyrin) fused with MLL. 
Gephyrin is a rat glycine receptor-associated protein, which forms submembranous 
complexes and anchor glycine or gamma-aminobutyric acidA receptors to 
microtubules. Alternative splicing of human gephyrin gene created two different 
forms of fusion cDNA. In one form, human gephyrin gene fused in-frame to MLL 
exon 9, and the chimeric product had COOH terminus of human gephyrin protein, 
including the tubulin binding site. In the other, the reading frame terminated 
shortly after the fusion point. As a result, only seven amino acids with no 
known function were attached to the NH2 terminus of MLL protein. The functional 
significance of this de facto truncated MLL gene product is not clear.

The clinical course of leprosy is often interrupted by reactions, which are 
acute inflammatory episodes that can be classified as type I or type II. Type II 
reactions can present as cutaneous lesions that resemble erythema multiforme 
(EM). EM is classically associated with drug allergies or pre-existing viral 
infections. However, the differential diagnostic criteria of the diverse 
causative agents remain controversial. The aim of this study was to determine 
both the clinical relevance and the morphological and immunohistochemical 
characteristics of the EM-like lesions during the course of type II leprosy 
reactions. Twenty-seven skin biopsies were taken from typical EM-like lesions of 
multibacillary patients and reviewed; their histological features were 
correlated to their clinical aspects. Then, a computer-assisted morphometric 
analysis was performed to measure the extent of angiogenesis during these acute 
episodes. The histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis of the EM 
lesions revealed that they shared the same features that have been previously 
described for ENL, including immunopositivity in the identical cell-mediated 
immune markers. Our results point to leprosy as the cause of the EM-like lesions 
in our patients. Therefore, leprosy should be considered in the differential 
diagnosis of EM.

We observed the mature granulocytes/monocytes derived from leukemic cells in 
patients with acute myeloid leukemia who present mixed lineage leukemia gene 
(MLL). Morphologic observation and fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis 
(FISH) for chromosome 11q23 abnormality were studied, and a multiplex reverse 
transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis was done to identify 
the fusion partners with MLL. The bone marrow cells with FISH signals of MLL 
showed the cell differentiation of the myeloid and/or monocytic lineages in 4 of 
6 AML patients. MLL partner genes were AF6, AF9, ELL, and ENL, respectively. 
There was no correlation between the fusion partner and the appearance of mature 
cells derived from MLL clones. RT-PCR showed the fusion between MLL exon 9 or 10 
and the partner genes in mature granulocytes/monocytes. These findings suggest 
that subgroup of leukemia cells with MLL rearrangement has the differentiation 
potential of leukemic cells and mature granulocytes/monocytes derived from MLL 
clones may be biologically different from normal mature cells.

AIM OF THE STUDY: To study the effects, secondary effects and security of the 
intrasurgical application of mitomicyn C during endonasal and endocanalicular 
dacryocystorhinostomy with diode laser (TLA-ELA DCR).
METHODS: We carried out a randomized, prospective, interventional and double 
blind study in 200 patients: intrasurgical mitomicyn C was applied in 150 of 
then (0.4 mgr/0.2 ml) for 5 minutes by means of a polivinil acetate dressing 
over the osteotomy. In other 50 patients MMC was not used we followed up at 24 
hours, 10 days and 1, 3 and 6 months after surgery. Endoscopic aspects and 
possible complications were valued. The results were compared using the 
Chi-squared test with the Yates correction. We looked for the presence or 
abscense of secondary effects in the application of mitomicyn C.
RESULTS: The average follow up was 15.25 months (range 6 to 21 months). The 
percentages of alterations for excesive scarring were 21.77% in patients without 
and MAC 8.03% in the ones MMC. The difference was statisticaly significant (p = 
0.02). We did not find secondary effects due to application of mitomcyn.
CONCLUSIONS: Intrasurgical application of topical MMC during TLA-ENL DCR reduces 
the number of pathological findings due to scarring of the surrouding area of 
the new drainage without secondary effects.

The authors analysed the feature of frontal facial soft tissue of 150 native 
adults of Guangdong province by using the computer assisted 
photogrammetric-system made by the authors, which contained several new mode 
parameters planed by the authors.
THE RESULTS: 1. The mean measurements of six parameters (Sn-Mes, Gs-Mes, 
Exr-Exl, Enr-Enl. [symbol: see text]Zyr-Rc-Mes, [symbol: see text]Zyl-Lc-Mes.) 
of the male subjects were larger than those of the female subjects, and the mean 
measurements of two parameters (Zyr-Zyl/Gs-Mes, Rc-Lc/Gs-Mes) of the male 
subjects were smaller than the ones of the female subjects. 2. The four 
measurements (Tr-Mes, Gs-Sn, Zyr-Zyl, Chr-Chl) in both male and female subjects 
of Guangdong province were smaller than the ones of Sichuan and Shandong 
provinces, and one measurement (Tr-Gs) of Guangdong male subjects was also 
smaller than the one of Sichuan or Shandong province, and one measurement of 
Guangdong female subjects smaller than the one of Shandong province. The 
conclusions: 1. The normal native adults of han race of Guangdong province show 
sex-difference and region-difference in the feature of frontal facial soft 
tissue. 2. The new-mode parameters (such as: [symbol: see text]Zyr-RC-Mes, 
[symbol: see text]Zyl-Lc-Mes, Zyr-Zyl/Gs-Mes, Rc-Lc/Gs-Mes) are helpful in 
studying the feature of frontal facial soft tissue.

[Cutaneous or subcutaneous calcinosis observed in leprosy patients. 1. Clinical 
observations].

[Article in Japanese]

Maeda M(1), Narita M.

Author information:
(1)National Leprosarium Tama Zensho-En, Tokyo, Japan.

A roentgenographic examination was made for the limbs of leprosy patients with 
calcinosis in whom atrophic cutaneous sclerosis and subcutaneous induration or 
infiltration were observed. The observation results are summarized as follows. 
1. Atrophic cutaneous sclerosis was one of a sequela in lepromatous lesion, 
especially in case of ENL, and it was observed to occur frequently at the 
extended sides of 1/3distal part from the forearm and the crus mainly. The 
atrophied cutaneous surface was tinged with lustrous red. It was able to observe 
calcium deposition directly just under the skin and/or in the shallow 
subcutaneous region from the roentgenogram of the site. The roentgenographic 
patterns were demonstrated as if many granules were scattered, and also the 
dendric and reticular platy-expansions were detected in some cases. The 
enucleated parts seemed to be similar to the cancellous bone. It might be said 
that dystrophic calcinosis cutis developed by inducing histological disorder is 
one of the origin of such a calcinosis, because the skin in these regions is 
deficient in the mobility and tends to provoke the circulatory disorder in case 
of chronic inflammation as discerned in lepromatous lesion. 2. An induration in 
subcutaneous tissue is lipid lump being as it was when chaulmoogra oil was 
injected and not undergo absorption of the oil. The lipid lumps enveloped in the 
tunic were observed in the site of lateral upperarm and the front of femur. They 
seemed to be remained almost all as it was. It was observed that the lipid 
lumps, as such, were adjacent to the outer layer of fascia, but not in the 
muscle. And there are some cases where the oil flowed from the injection site 
through the hypodermis and got the lipid lumps formed in the forearm and/or the 
crus. Roentgenogram of that showed the existence of calcinosis regardless of 
size which transmissivity of X-ray had an irregular pattern. The enucleated 
lipid lumps were easily cut to pieces by scalpel. 3. It may be said that the 
calcinosis observed in atrophic cutaneous sclerosis due to lepromatous lesion or 
lipid lump of unabsorbed chaulmoogra oil makes it necessary for its healing to 
be 10-20 years. 4. Roentgenogram at that time revealed no abnormality as to 
serum calcium, phosphorous and/or alkaline phosphatase values.

100 leprosy patients were studied for audiovestibular involvement. Conductive 
hearing loss was detected in 6 cases of BT leprosy, all of them having 
coincidental chronic middle ear infection. Sensori-neural hearing loss was 
detected in 10 cases, of which 6 had LL, 2 BT and 2 pure neuritic type of 
disease respectively. All the cases of lepromatous leprosy having sensorineural 
hearing loss had evidence of ENL reaction. Vestibular involvement was not 
detected in any of the cases. Evaluation of audiovestibular function was also 
carried out in 50 fresh cases of leprosy and after 3 months, 6 months and 1 year 
of multidrug therapy to ascertain any ototoxic side effects of antileprosy

Acetylated lysine residues (Kac) in histones are recognized by epigenetic reader 
proteins, such as Yaf9, ENL, AF9, Taf14, and Sas5 (YEATS) domain-containing 
proteins. Human YEATS domains bind to the acetylated N-terminal tail of histone 
H3; however, their Kac-binding preferences at the level of the nucleosome are 
unknown. Through genetic code reprogramming, here, we established a nucleosome 
core particle (NCP) array containing histones that were acetylated at specific 
residues and used it to compare the Kac-binding preferences of human YEATS 
domains. We found that AF9-YEATS showed basal binding to the unmodified NCP and 
that it bound stronger to the NCP containing a single acetylation at one of K4, 
K9, K14, or K27 of H3, or to histone H4 multi-acetylated between K5 and K16. 
Crystal structures of AF9-YEATS in complex with an H4 peptide diacetylated 
either at K5/K8 or K8/K12 revealed that the aromatic cage of the YEATS domain 
recognized the acetylated K8 residue. Interestingly, E57 and D103 of AF9, both 
located outside of the aromatic cage, were shown to interact with acetylated K5 
and K12 of H4, respectively, consistent with the increase in AF9-YEATS binding 
to the H4K8-acetylated NCP upon additional acetylation at K5 or K12. Finally, we 
show that a mutation of E57 to alanine in AF9-YEATS reduced the binding affinity 
for H4 multiacetylated NCPs containing H4K5ac. Our data suggest that the 
Kac-binding affinity of AF9-YEATS increases additively with the number of Kac in 
the histone tail.

Endoscopic management of pancreatic pseudocysts.

Samuelson AL(1), Shah RJ.

Author information:
(1)University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, USA.

Techniques of endoscopic pseudocyst management continue to evolve, but the 
principles of proper patient selection and careful consideration of the 
available therapeutic options remain unchanged. Endoscopic management is 
considered first-line therapy in the treatment of symptomatic pseudocysts. 
Clinicians should be vigilant in the evaluation of all peripancreatic fluid 
collections to exclude the presence of a pancreatic cystic neoplasm and avoid 
draining an immature collection. Expectant management with periodic observation 
should be considered for the minimally symptomatic patients, even after the 
traditional 6 weeks of maturation. Further, symptoms, complications, and 
expansion on serial imaging should prompt intervention by endoscopic, surgical, 
or percutaneous methods. Pseudocysts should only be punctured when the wall has 
had sufficient time to mature and after pseudoaneurysm has been ruled out by 
careful imaging. Small to moderately sized pseudocysts (< 4–6 cm) that 
communicate with the pancreatic duct are good candidates for endoscopic 
transpapillary stenting. For larger lesions requiring transmural drainage, EUS 
guidance is preferable, but good results can be achieved with ENL. EUS may be 
particularly useful in permitting drainage in patients with suspected 
perigastric varices or if an endoscopically visible bulge is not apparent. 
Necrosis is a significant factor for a worse outcome; aggressive debridement 
with nasocystic or percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy-cystic catheter lavage 
plus manual endoscopic techniques for clearing debris should be used. Endoscopic 
failure, especially in cases with significant necrosis, should be managed 
operatively. Percutaneous drainage is a good option for immature infected 
pseudocysts or in patients who are not optimal candidates for other procedures. 
Close cooperation between endoscopists, surgeons, interventional radiologists, 
and other healthcare providers is paramount in successfully managing these 
patients.

[Acute myeloblastic leukaemia with alternations of MLL proto-oncogene protein 
(11q23/MLL+ AML)].

One of the most common chromosomal breakpoint regions in acute myeloid leukaemia 
is the chromosome band 11q23. The analysis of this region led to the discovery 
of the extremely promiscuous MLL gene, in which more than 60 MLL translocation 
partner genes have been described. Among the most frequent are 
t(9;11)(p21-22;q23)/MLL-AF9, t(10; 11)(p13; q23)/MLL-AF10, 
t(11;19)(q23;p13)/MLL-ELL, ENL and t(6;11)(q27;q23)/MLL-AF6. The presented work 
provides an overview of the molecular mechanisms by means of which MLL 
proto-oncogene can be converted into oncogene. Genetic alternations of the MLL 
Proto-Oncogene Protein besides translocation are also represented by complex 
chromosomal rearrangements, deletions, insertions, partial tandem duplications, 
amplifications and gains. These genetic alterations are described in the work 
from the diagnostic and prognostic point of view. Abnormalities of the MLL 
ProtoOncogene Protein are usually connected with bad prognosis. For that reason, 
in oncological practice, particular attention is paid to introducing new genetic 
methods for their identification. The above work gives well arranged information 
about different types of genetic tests and their outcomes, which can help 
oncologists in predicting the prognosis, in minimal residual disease monitoring 
and in modifying oncological patient treatment.

Primary extranodal lymphomas (ENLs) are lymphomas with no or minor nodal 
involvement and a dominant extranodal component originating from any organ. 
Primary ENL originating in the genitourinary tract is extremely rare. Diffuse 
large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most frequent histological subtype in 
primary genitourinary lymphoma. Lymphomatous involvement of genitourinary system 
organs is common in the setting of disseminated disease. Herein, we present a 
unique case of primary multicentric extranodal DLBCL of the urogenital system 
involving ureter, seminal vesicle, and penis detected on 18fluro-deoxyglucose 
positron emission tomography with computed tomography, and to the best of our 
knowledge, it is the first case report with multiorgan involvement within a 
single (urogenital) organ system in a patient without disseminated disease, 
i.e., with no other nodal or extranodal organ system involvement.

Comparative efficacy of four treatment regimens in Type 2 Leprosy Reactions 
(Prednisolone alone, Thalidomide alone, Prednisolone plus Thalidomide and 
Prednisolone plus Clofazimine).

Kar HK, Gupta L.

This study has been carried out to assess the comparative efficacy of 
Prednisolone alone or thalidomide alone for the first attack of T2R, and 
combination of prednisolone plus thalidomide or prednisolone plus clofazimine 
for chronic and recurrent T2R. Efficacy of all four regimens was assessed on the 
basis of clinical recovery of T2R measured by reaction severity scores (RSS) 
,visual analogue scale (VAS) and other relevant parameters, requirement of extra 
dose of steroid for clinical recovery, recurrence of T2R and side effects 
observed in each regimen. The designof study was an open prospective 
longitudinal single centre investigation. In the first episode T2R group I 
(prednisolone alone) the efficacy was 58.8% (10/17) compared to 93.75% (15/16) 
in Group 2 treated with thalidomide alone. This difference was statistically 
significant p <0.05 when compared using unpaired ttest. When clinical outcome 
was compared in recurrent/relapse of T2R Groups 3 and 4, it was observed to be 
statistically significant p<0.05 when compared using unpaired t test. It was 
82.35% (14/17) in Group 3 (prednisolone plus clofazimine) and 10/16 (62.5%) in 
Group 4 (prednislone plus clofazimine). To conclude, for the management of 
recurrent/chronic ENL, both the combinations-prednisolone with thalidomide or 
clofazimine appear to be efficacious. While prednisolone with thalidomide 
appears to be better than prednisolone and clofazimine, however, by 20 weeks 
difference narrows down. As of now these findings may be considered indicative 
and larger experience on more number of cases using robust statistical design is 
required for marchingtowards making recommendations for clinical application.

Fetal and adult hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) are 
characterized by distinct redox homeostasis that may influence their 
differential cellular behavior in normal and malignant hematopoiesis. In this 
work, we have applied a quantitative mass spectrometry-based redox proteomic 
approach to comprehensively describe reversible cysteine modifications in 
primary mouse fetal and adult HSPCs. We defined the redox state of 4,438 
cysteines in fetal and adult HSPCs and demonstrated a higher susceptibility to 
oxidation of protein thiols in fetal HSPCs. Our data identified ontogenic 
changes to oxidation state of thiols in proteins with a pronounced role in 
metabolism and protein homeostasis. Additional redox proteomic analysis 
identified oxidation changes to thiols acting in mitochondrial respiration as 
well as protein homeostasis to be triggered during onset of MLL-ENL 
leukemogenesis in fetal HSPCs. Our data has demonstrated that redox signaling 
contributes to the regulation of fundamental processes of developmental 
hematopoiesis and has pinpointed potential targetable redox-sensitive proteins 
in in utero-initiated MLL-rearranged leukemia.

Chromosomal translocations involving the mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene cause 
aggressive leukemia. Fusion proteins of MLL and a component of the AF4 
family/ENL family/P-TEFb complex (AEP) are responsible for two-thirds of 
MLL-associated leukemia cases. MLL-AEP fusion proteins trigger aberrant 
self-renewal of hematopoietic progenitors by constitutively activating 
self-renewal-related genes. MLL-AEP fusion proteins activate transcription 
initiation by loading the TATA-binding protein (TBP) to the TATA element via 
selectivity factor 1. Although AEP retains transcription elongation and mediator 
recruiting activities, the rate-limiting step activated by MLL-AEP fusion 
proteins appears to be the TBP-loading step. This is contrary to prevailing 
views, in which the recruitment of transcription elongation activities are 
emphasized. Here, I review recent advances towards elucidating the mechanisms 
underlying gene activation by MLL-AEP fusion proteins in leukemogenesis.

Paris, France.

BACKGROUND: Detection of fluorescent probes by fluorescence in situ 
hybridization in cells with preserved three-dimensional nuclear structures 
(3D-FISH) is useful for studying the organization of chromatin and localization 
of genes in interphase nuclei. Fast and reliable measurements of the relative 
positioning of fluorescent spots specific to subchromosomal regions and genes 
would improve understanding of cell structure and function.
METHODS: 3D-FISH protocol, confocal microscopy, and digital image analysis were 
used.
RESULTS: New software (Smart 3D-FISH) has been developed to automate the process 
of spot segmentation and distance measurements in images from 3D-FISH 
experiments. It can handle any number of fluorescent spots and incorporate 
images of 4',6-diamino-2-phenylindole counterstained nuclei to measure the 
relative positioning of spot loci in the nucleus and inter-spot distance. 
Results from a pilot experiment using Smart 3D-FISH on ENL, MLL, and AF4 genes 
in two lymphoblastic cell lines were satisfactory and consistent with data 
published in the literature.
CONCLUSION: Smart 3D-FISH should greatly facilitate image processing and 
analysis of 3D-FISH images by providing a useful tool to overcome the laborious 
task of image segmentation based on user-defined parameters and decrease 
subjectivity in data analysis. It is available as a set of plugins for ImageJ 
software.

Pilot study to determine acceptability and ability of heat-killed Mycobacterium 
leprae plus BCG (HKML+BCG) vaccine to induce skin test conversion.

Although local reactions, including erythema, induration and ulcers, appeared in 
every patient after the injection of the combined HKML+BCG vaccine, they were 
accepted by the patients. There was no tendency for the local reaction to become 
aggravated after repeated vaccination. However, systemic reactions, mainly 
iridocyclitis and complaint of numbness of the fingers and toes, became quite 
common after the 5th vaccination and therefore significantly reduced the 
acceptability of vaccine by injection. It seems that repeated vaccination might 
activate the iridocyclitis, but the relationship between the complaint of 
numbness and vaccination has not been well established. Neither typical ENL nor 
reversal reaction had been observed throughout the trial. A significant 
proportion of patients converted to SMLA positivity after repeated vaccination. 
However, it seems the positive status was not stable as many of them reverted to 
negative after the following vaccination. After the 7th vaccination, the 
positive conversion rate to SMLA-I was 45% and to SMLA-II was 35%. After the 8th 
vaccination, 66.7% of patients converted to Mitsuda reaction positive, which has 
been confirmed by histopathological examination. Nevertheless, further follow-up 
is required in order to determine whether or not such conversion will be of a 
long duration. The reactions to SMLA-I and SMLA-II were associated but only 
correlated at a moderate level. Overall, the positive conversion rate to SMLA-I 
was significantly higher than that to SMLA-II after repeated vaccination. 
Neither the early reaction nor the late (Mitsuda) reaction of the lepromin test 
were correlated to either SMLA reaction. The repeated vaccination of HKML+BCG 
vaccine did not affect the weakly-positive anti-PGL-1 Mycobacterium leprae 
antibody level seen in the skin-smear negative lepromatous patients 
participating in this study.

Leukaemogenic mutations commonly disrupt cellular differentiation and/or enhance 
proliferation, thus perturbing the regulatory programs that control self-renewal 
and differentiation of stem and progenitor cells. Translocations involving the 
Mll1 (Kmt2a) gene generate powerful oncogenic fusion proteins, predominantly 
affecting infant and paediatric AML and ALL patients. The early stages of 
leukaemogenic transformation are typically inaccessible from human patients and 
conventional mouse models. Here, we take advantage of cells conditionally 
blocked at the multipotent haematopoietic progenitor stage to develop a MLL-r 
model capturing early cellular and molecular consequences of MLL-ENL expression 
based on a clear clonal relationship between parental and leukaemic cells. 
Through a combination of scRNA-seq, ATAC-seq and genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 
screening, we identify pathways and genes likely to drive the early phases of 
leukaemogenesis. Finally, we demonstrate the broad utility of using matched 
parental and transformed cells for small molecule inhibitor studies by 
validating both previously known and other potential therapeutic targets.

Interim analyses of a phase I study with GSK2857916, an antibody-drug conjugate 
against B cell maturation antigen, have previously reported a 60% overall 
response and 7.9 months progression-free survival in relapsed/refractory 
multiple myeloma (MM). We provide updated safety and efficacy results of the 
BMA117159 trial following an additional 14 months' follow-up. This open-label, 
first-in-human, phase I study was conducted at nine centres in the USA, Canada 
and the UK, and included adults with MM and progressive disease after stem cell 
transplantation, alkylators, proteasome inhibitors, and immunomodulators. In 
part 1, the recommended dose of 3.4 mg/kg was identified; in part 2, patients 
received GSK2857916 3.4 mg/kg once every 3 weeks. Selected part 2 
safety/tolerability and efficacy endpoints are reported. Twenty-one (60.0%; 95% 
confidence interval (CI) 42.1-76.1) of 35 patients achieved partial response or 
better, including two stringent complete responses and three complete responses. 
The median progression-free survival was 12 months and median duration of 
response was 14.3 months. Thrombocytopenia and corneal events were commonly 
reported; no new safety signals were identified. GSK2857916 was well tolerated 
and demonstrated a rapid, deep and durable response in heavily pre-treated 
patients with relapsed/refractory MM, consolidating the interim analyses 
conclusions that GSK2857916 is a promising treatment for these patients.

The present study set out to explore the option of developing food portion size 
for nutritional labelling purposes using two European Union (EU) dietary 
surveys. The surveys were selected as they differed in (a) methodologies (food 
diary versus food frequency questionnaire), (b) populations (Irish National 
Adult Nutrition Survey (NANS) versus a seven-country survey based on the pan EU 
study Food4Me), (c) food quantification (multiple options versus solely 
photographic album) and (d) duration (4 consecutive days versus recent month). 
Using data from these studies, portion size was determined for 15 test foods, 
where portion size was defined as the median intake of a target food when 
consumed. The median values of the portion sizes derived from both the NANS and 
Food4Me surveys were correlated (r = 0.823; p < 0.00) and the mean of the two 
survey data sets were compared to US values from the Recognized as Customarily 
Consumed (RACC) database. There was very strong agreement across all food 
categories between the averaged EU and the US portion size (r = 0.947; p < 
0.00). It is concluded that notwithstanding the variety of approaches used for 
dietary survey data in the EU, the present data supports using a standardized 
approach to food portion size quantification for food labelling in the EU.

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) arises when leukemia-initiating cells, defined by a 
primary genetic lesion, acquire subsequent molecular changes whose cumulative 
effects bypass tumor suppression. The changes that underlie AML pathogenesis not 
only provide insights into the biology of transformation but also reveal novel 
therapeutic opportunities. However, backtracking these events in transformed 
human AML samples is challenging, if at all possible. Here, we approached this 
question using a murine in vivo model with an MLL-ENL fusion protein as a 
primary molecular event. Upon clonal transformation, we identified and 
extensively verified a recurrent codon-changing mutation (Arg295Cys) in the ERM 
protein moesin that markedly accelerated leukemogenesis. Human cancer-associated 
moesin mutations at the conserved arginine-295 residue similarly enhanced 
MLL-ENL-driven leukemogenesis. Mechanistically, the mutation interrupted the 
stability of moesin and conferred a neomorphic activity to the protein, which 
converged on enhanced extracellular signal-regulated kinase activity. Thereby, 
our studies demonstrate a critical role of ERM proteins in AML, with 
implications also for human cancer.

Histone acetylation is associated with active transcription in eukaryotic cells. 
It helps to open up the chromatin by neutralizing the positive charge of histone 
lysine residues and providing binding platforms for "reader" proteins. The 
bromodomain (BRD) has long been thought to be the sole protein module that 
recognizes acetylated histones. Recently, we identified the YEATS domain of AF9 
(ALL1 fused gene from chromosome 9) as a novel acetyl-lysine-binding module and 
showed that the ENL (eleven-nineteen leukemia) YEATS domain is an essential 
acetyl-histone reader in acute myeloid leukemias. The human genome encodes four 
YEATS domain proteins, including GAS41, a component of chromatin remodelers 
responsible for H2A.Z deposition onto chromatin; however, the importance of the 
GAS41 YEATS domain in human cancer remains largely unknown. Here we report that 
GAS41 is frequently amplified in human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and is 
required for cancer cell proliferation, survival, and transformation. 
Biochemical and crystal structural studies demonstrate that GAS41 binds to 
histone H3 acetylated on H3K27 and H3K14, a specificity that is distinct from 
that of AF9 or ENL. ChIP-seq (chromatin immunoprecipitation [ChIP] followed by 
high-throughput sequencing) analyses in lung cancer cells reveal that GAS41 
colocalizes with H3K27ac and H3K14ac on the promoters of actively transcribed 
genes. Depletion of GAS41 or disruption of the interaction between its YEATS 
domain and acetylated histones impairs the association of histone variant H2A.Z 
with chromatin and consequently suppresses cancer cell growth and survival both 
in vitro and in vivo. Overall, our study identifies GAS41 as a histone 
acetylation reader that promotes histone H2A.Z deposition in NSCLC.

Important biological and pathologic properties are often conserved across 
species. Although several mouse leukemia models have been well established, the 
genes deregulated in both human and murine leukemia cells have not been studied 
systematically. We performed a serial analysis of gene expression in both human 
and murine MLL-ELL or MLL-ENL leukemia cells and identified 88 genes that seemed 
to be significantly deregulated in both types of leukemia cells, including 57 
genes not reported previously as being deregulated in MLL-associated leukemias. 
These changes were validated by quantitative PCR. The most up-regulated genes 
include several HOX genes (e.g., HOX A5, HOXA9, and HOXA10) and MEIS1, which are 
the typical hallmark of MLL rearrangement leukemia. The most down-regulated 
genes include LTF, LCN2, MMP9, S100A8, S100A9, PADI4, TGFBI, and CYBB. Notably, 
the up-regulated genes are enriched in gene ontology terms, such as gene 
expression and transcription, whereas the down-regulated genes are enriched in 
signal transduction and apoptosis. We showed that the CpG islands of the 
down-regulated genes are hypermethylated. We also showed that seven individual 
microRNAs (miRNA) from the mir-17-92 cluster, which are overexpressed in human 
MLL rearrangement leukemias, are also consistently overexpressed in mouse MLL 
rearrangement leukemia cells. Nineteen possible targets of these miRNAs were 
identified, and two of them (i.e., APP and RASSF2) were confirmed further by 
luciferase reporter and mutagenesis assays. The identification and validation of 
consistent changes of gene expression in human and murine MLL rearrangement 
leukemias provide important insights into the genetic base for MLL-associated 
leukemogenesis.

Therapy-associated myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukaemia 
(t-AML/MDS) following high dose chemotherapy are significant problems, with a 
cumulative incidence of 20% or more in myeloablative treatment regimen. 
Retrospective findings indicated that t-AML/MDS associated genetic aberrations 
can be observed directly after exposure to chemotherapy and can precede t-AML by 
several months. To determine the incidence of post-therapeutic aberrations and 
their predictive value, we prospectively investigated 316 samples of 95 patients 
with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) who were treated with intermediate and high dose 
chemotherapy (Arm A and B of the megaCHOEP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, 
etoposide, vincristine, prednisolone) trial of the German High Grade NHL study 
group). Molecular aberrations (RUNX1/RUNX1T1, PML-RARA, CBFB-MYH11, MLL-MLLT1, 
BCR-ABL1) were observed in 33.3% (Arm A) and 55.4% (Arm B) of patients and in 
14.9% and 28.7% of respective samples. Cytogenetic analysis of 53 NHL patients 
after high dose therapy showed frequent chromosomal breakage. Clonal aberrations 
were found in three patients. None of these patients developed a t-AML/MDS 
during a 3-year clinical follow up period. We concluded that the high incidence 
of genetic aberrations reflected a dose-dependent, transient therapy-induced 
genetic damage which is not predictive of a t-AML/MDS.

Gene rearrangement of the mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene causes leukemia by 
inducing the constitutive expression of a gene subset normally expressed only in 
the immature haematopoietic progenitor cells. MLL gene rearrangements often 
generate fusion products of MLL and a component of the AF4 family/ENL 
family/P-TEFb (AEP) complex. MLL-AEP fusion proteins have the potential of 
constitutively recruiting the P-TEFb elongation complex. Thus, it is 
hypothesized that relieving the promoter proximal pausing of RNA polymerase II 
is the rate-limiting step of MLL fusion-dependent transcription. AEP also has 
the potential to recruit the mediator complex via MED26. We recently showed that 
AEP activates transcription initiation by facilitating TBP loading to the TATA 
element through the SL1 complex. In the present study, we show that the key 
activity responsible for the oncogenic property of MLL-AEP fusion proteins is 
the TBP loading activity, and not the mediator recruitment or transcriptional 
elongation activities. Thus, we propose that TBP loading by AF4 through SL1 is 
the major rate-limiting step in MLL fusion-dependent transcription.

MicroRNA-126 regulates HOXA9 by binding to the homeobox.

USA. wfshen@itsa.ucsf.edu

The PicTar program predicted that microRNA-126 (miR-126), miR-145, and let-7s 
target highly conserved sites within the Hoxa9 homeobox. There are increased 
nucleotide constraints in the three microRNA seed sites among Hoxa9 genes beyond 
that required to maintain protein identity, suggesting additional functional 
conservation. In preliminary experiments, forced expression of these microRNAs 
in Hoxa9-immortalized bone marrow cells downregulated the HOXA9 protein and 
caused loss of biological activity. The microRNAs were shown to target their 
predicted sites within the homeobox. miR-126 and Hoxa9 mRNA are coexpressed in 
hematopoietic stem cells and downregulated in parallel during progenitor cell 
differentiation; however, miR-145 is barely detectable in hematopoietic cells, 
and let-7s are highly expressed in bone marrow progenitors, suggesting that 
miR-126 may function in normal hematopoietic cells to modulate HOXA9 protein. In 
support of this hypothesis, expression of miR-126 alone in MLL-ENL-immortalized 
bone marrow cells decreased endogenous HOXA9 protein, while inhibition of 
endogenous miR-126 increased expression of HOXA9 in F9 cells.

Single dose vaccination was carried out with Mycobacterium habana vaccine, 31 
lepromatous leprosy cases receiving 1.5 mg (1.5 mg = 6.27 x 10(8) bacilli) and 
36 household contacts randomly receiving 1.5, 2.0, 2.5 mg vaccine intradermally. 
Duration of study was 18 weeks. Vaccination induced lepromin conversion in 100% 
of lepromatous leprosy cases and lepromin negative household contacts and 
augmentation of lepromin reactivity in 100% of lepromin positive household 
contacts, which was stable for the 15 weeks duration of follow-up. The maximum 
augmentation in lepromin reactivity was obtained with 1.5 mg of vaccine, which 
is probably the supramaximal dose. Overall, post-vaccination, those without 
prior BCG vaccination scars showed higher mean values of lepromin augmentation. 
Local vaccination site changes included induration, ulceration, itching, pain 
and uncomplicated regional lymphadenopathy, all of which remitted spontaneously 
by 15 weeks. Systemic side-effects noted were pyrexia, ENL and jaundice, and 
were seen with no greater frequency than that reported in other vaccine trials. 
Overall, systemic side-effects were easily controlled and were not accompanied 
by clinically detectable nerve or ocular damage. The safety profile 
investigations revealed an increase in the mean values of Hb%, RBC count and PCV 
in household contacts and of PCV in lepromatous patients, post-vaccination. 
Alterations in the liver function tests were also observed in patients of 
lepromatous leprosy. Thus, M. habana vaccine appears to be useful in stimulating 
specific CMI against M. leprae as evidenced by increased lepromin reactivity.

STEEP Global Institute, Dallas.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the reliability and validity of the Financial Management 
Competency Self-assessment (FMCA) in executive nurse leaders (ENLs) and to 
determine how ENLs develop and apply financial knowledge.
BACKGROUND: Financial literacy (FL) helps in planning, implementing, and 
evaluating fiscal decisions, but many ENLs report weaknesses in this core 
competency.
METHODS: An explanatory-sequential mixed-methods study was conducted to 
psychometrically test the FMCA and explore how ENLs with different levels of FL 
develop and apply financial knowledge. Eligible participants (n = 178) were 
recruited from a population of ENLs across the United States.
RESULTS: The test-retest reliability of the FMCA was good (mean difference, 
6.80; 95% confidence interval). Correlations between domain scores (P < .01) and 
the overall score (Cronbach's α = .99) demonstrated the reliability and validity 
of the instrument. The cutoff scores were fair indicators of different levels of 
FL in ENLs (P < .001). Self-awareness, gaps in hospital and graduate nursing 
education, application of financial knowledge, and a micro versus macro view 
emerged as important themes in the qualitative analysis.
CONCLUSION: FMCA reliability and validity were established. FMCA cutoff scores 
were established to determine FL level, and the ENL lived experience described 
in financial knowledge development and application.

Histone post-translational modifications (PTMs) carry an epigenetic layer of 
message to regulate diverse cellular processes at the chromatin level. Many of 
these PTMs are selectively recognized by dedicated effector proteins for normal 
cell growth and development, while dysregulation of these recognition events is 
often implicated in human diseases, notably cancer. Thus, it is fundamentally 
important to elucidate the regulatory mechanism(s) underlying the readout of 
PTMs on histones. The Yaf9, ENL, AF9, Taf14, Sas5 (YEATS) domain is an emerging 
reader module that selectively recognizes histone lysine acylation with a 
preference for crotonylation over acetylation. In the review, we discuss the 
recognition of histone acylations by the YEATS domain and the biological 
significance of this readout from multiple perspectives.

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a clonal disease originating from myeloid 
progenitor cells with a heterogeneous genetic background. High-dose cytarabine 
is used as the standard consolidation chemotherapy. Oncogenic RAS mutations are 
frequently observed in AML, and are associated with beneficial response to 
cytarabine. Why AML-patients with oncogenic RAS benefit most from high-dose 
cytarabine post-remission therapy is not well understood. Here we used bone 
marrow cells expressing a conditional MLL-ENL-ER oncogene to investigate the 
interaction of oncogenic RAS and chemotherapeutic agents. We show that oncogenic 
RAS synergizes with cytotoxic agents such as cytarabine in activation of DNA 
damage checkpoints, resulting in a p53-dependent genetic program that reduces 
clonogenicity and increases myeloid differentiation. Our data can explain the 
beneficial effects observed for AML patients with oncogenic RAS treated with 
higher dosages of cytarabine and suggest that induction of p53-dependent 
differentiation, e.g. by interfering with Mdm2-mediated degradation, may be a 
rational approach to increase cure rate in response to chemotherapy. The data 
also support the notion that the therapeutic success of cytotoxic drugs may 
depend on their ability to promote the differentiation of tumor-initiating 
cells.

This study was aimed to investigate the clinical feasibility of using multiplex 
PT-PCR assay for screening rare/cryptic chromosome translocations in patients 
with de novo acute myeloid leukemia. For 126 patients with de novo AML-M4/M5 
without common chromosome translocations including t(15;17), t(8;21) and 
t(16;16), 3 parallel multiplex RT-PCR assays were set up to detect 6 mll-related 
gene rearrangements (mll/af10, mll/af17, mll/ell, mll/af9, mll/af6 and mll/enl) 
with low detection rate and 4 rare fusion genes (dek/can, tls/erg, aml1/mds 
(evi1) and npm/mlf1). The results showed that 11 patients with positive result 
from 126 patients were detected which involved in 5 molecular abnormalities. 
Among them, 10 cases were AML-M5 (16.67%), 1 cases AML-M4 (1.51%). The marker 
chromosomes were observed in 2 cases out of 11 cases through conventional 
karyotyping analysis, the karyotyping analysis in 1 case was not performed 
because this case had 1 mitotic figure only, no any cytogenetic aberrations were 
found in other 8 cases through R-band karyotyping analysis. It is concluded that 
multiplex RT-PCR designed in this study can quickly, effectively and accurately 
identify the rare/cryptic chromosome translocations and can be used in clinical 
detection.

Ontario, M5G 1L7, Canada.

Our understanding of leukemia development and progression has been hampered by 
the lack of in vivo models in which disease is initiated from primary human 
hematopoietic cells. We showed that upon transplantation into immunodeficient 
mice, primitive human hematopoietic cells expressing a mixed-lineage leukemia 
(MLL) fusion gene generated myeloid or lymphoid acute leukemias, with features 
that recapitulated human diseases. Analysis of serially transplanted mice 
revealed that the disease is sustained by leukemia-initiating cells (L-ICs) that 
have evolved over time from a primitive cell type with a germline immunoglobulin 
heavy chain (IgH) gene configuration to a cell type containing rearranged IgH 
genes. The L-ICs retained both myeloid and lymphoid lineage potential and 
remained responsive to microenvironmental cues. The properties of these cells 
provide a biological basis for several clinical hallmarks of MLL leukemias.

The status of assay for S-100 antigen protein and anticeramide antibodies in 
serum in understanding nerve damage in different forms of leprosy were evaluated 
by the enzyme immunoassay. Based on the clinical and smear examination, patients 
were classified as indeterminate (Ind), tuberculoid (TT), borderline tuberculoid 
(BT), borderline lepromatous (BL) and lepromatous (LL). Antibody levels against 
ceramide were observed in sera of leprosy patients with 37.5% of Ind, 28% of TT, 
66% BT, 78% BL and 62% LL patients positive as against 8% endemic normal sera. 
The mean OD ranged from 0.141 to 0.275 in different groups of leprosy. In 
contrast, S-100 was detected in 71.4% Ind, 88.8% TT, 76.4% BT, 100% BL and 95.8% 
LL, while 5% of ENL samples were positive for S-100 antigen. Mean S-100 levels 
in these different categories of patients were significantly higher Ind--0.45 
ng/ml, TT--0.32 ng/ml, BT--0.23 ng/ml, BL--0.23 ng/ml, LL--0.19 ng/ml as 
compared to that of normal 0.07 ng/ml. In general S-100 seems to be a more 
sensitive and reliable marker than anticeramide antibodies for nerve damage. 
Five out of 7 indeterminate cases show increased levels of S-100, showing an 
extent of nerve damage similar to that of TT and could be a useful marker for 
assessing nerve damage in indeterminate patients for better management.

treated with 12 months WHO MDT-MBR: a retrospective analysis of 730 patients 
from a leprosy clinic at a tertiary care hospital of Northern India.

BACKGROUND: Shortened (12 months) multidrug multibacillary regimen (MDT MBR) was 
implemented in India in 1998, however there is yet a paucity of crucial data on 
its long-term outcome.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of 12 months MDT MBR in multibacillary (MB) 
patients at our centre.
DESIGN: This was a retrospective study undertaken analysing the clinic records 
of 1210 patients registered at the leprosy clinic of our institute from 1999 to 
2010.
RESULTS: 730 MB patients were treated with 12 months MDT MBR over this period. 
High bacillary index (BI) > or = 3 + was observed in 313 patients at the time of 
registration. Four hundred and one (54.9%) patients experienced lepra reactions. 
Recurrent ENL was observed in only 14 patients which manifested even after 5 
years of stopping treatment. Clinico-histological correlation was noted in 361 
(49.5%) patients. During follow up period ranging from 9 months to 10 years, 
nearly all patients had clearance of skin lesions including 
histopathological/bacteriological improvement. Only 13 (1.7%) patients relapsed.
CONCLUSIONS: All patients responded well with 12 months MDT MBR without 
significant side effects. The overall relapse rate was only 1.7%. Thus, the 
recommendation for 12 months MDT MBR for all MB patients is robust and 
operationally practical, a decision which seems logical.

Identification and characterization of a molecule, BAM11, that associates with 
the pleckstrin homology domain of mouse Btk.

Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) is required for normal B cell development and 
signal transduction through cell surface molecules, and its defects lead to 
X-linked immune deficiency in mice and X-linked agammaglobulinemia in humans. In 
this report, we will describe the identification and characterization of a 
molecule, BAM11, which binds to the pleckstrin homology domain of Btk. A 
sequence homology search revealed that BAM11 has 89% homology, at the amino acid 
level, to human LTG19/ENL, that was originally identified as one of the fusion 
partners involved in chromosomal translocations of 11q23, MLL/ALL-1/HRX, in 
leukemia cells. Deletion mutants demonstrated that the region of BAM11 required 
for binding to Btk was localized between amino acid residues 240 and 256. Forced 
expression of a truncated form of BAM11 (amino acids 246-368) inhibited 
IL-5-induced proliferation by 50%, whereas forced expression of full-length 
BAM11 in Y16 cells did not affect the IL-5 responsiveness. We have also shown 
that BAM11 (amino acids 246-368) inhibited the kinase activity of Btk. These 
results suggest that the binding of BAM11 to Btk plays a regulatory role in the 
Btk signal transduction pathway. A cell fractionation study and analysis using 
EGFP-fused Btk protein demonstrated that a proportion of Btk is present within 
the nucleus.

BACKGROUND: Early onset colorectal cancer in persons younger than 50 years is 
increasingly common. Clinical and molecular characterizations reveal a 
distinctive disease. Thirty percent of patients have mutations of hereditary 
cancer syndromes, especially Lynch syndrome. A recent analysis, testing germline 
DNA for mutations in 25 cancer susceptibility genes, showed that some patients 
younger than 50 years had mutations of high-penetrance colorectal cancer genes 
such as APC (adenopolyposis coli). Others had mutations in high-penetrance or 
moderate-penetrance genes not traditionally associated with colorectal cancer, 
such as ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated), whereas still others had low 
penetrance colorectal cancer genes. In the current study, we examined the 
incidence of second cancers following early onset (age less than 50 y) 
colorectal cancer.
METHODS: The initial study population was assembled using records from the 
Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program of the National 
Cancer Institute. The SEER*Stat MP-SIR (multiple primary-standardized incidence 
ratio) tool was used to calculate SIRs and excess risk for second primary 
malignancies. The SIR is expressed as the ratio of observed-to-expected (O/E) 
cases. We used The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and AACR Project Genie for genetic 
analysis. The data were accessed with the online Xena Browser and cBioportal.
RESULTS: Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) O/E ratios were significantly >1 in 
patients aged less than 50 years, at 12 to 59 months after colorectal cancer. In 
patients aged 50 years and older, O/E ratios were equal to 1 or quite close at 
12 to 59 months after colorectal cancer. Alterations in 3 AML genes, CEBPA-AS1, 
MLLT1, and MLLT6, affected the prognosis of colorectal cancer patients less than 
50 years but not older than 50 years. One AML gene, FLT3, had the highest copy 
number alteration frequency of any gene in 1438 colorectal patients 18 to 48 
years of age. Genetic alterations of FLT3/TP53 were mutually exclusive. Genetic 
alterations of FLT3/JAK2 and JAK2/CTNNB1 were co-occurrent.
CONCLUSION: These observations suggest that early onset colorectal cancer and 
AML may be related diseases.

Survival in infants younger than 1 year who have acute lymphoblastic leukemia 
(ALL) is inferior whether MLL is rearranged (R) or germline (G). MLL 
translocations confer chemotherapy resistance, and infants experience excess 
complications. We characterized in vitro sensitivity to the pan-antiapoptotic 
BCL-2 family inhibitor obatoclax mesylate in diagnostic leukemia cells from 54 
infants with ALL/bilineal acute leukemia because of the role of prosurvival 
BCL-2 proteins in resistance, their imbalanced expression in infant ALL, and 
evidence of obatoclax activity with a favorable toxicity profile in early adult 
leukemia trials. Overall, half maximal effective concentrations (EC50s) were 
lower than 176 nM (the maximal plasma concentration [Cmax] with recommended 
adult dose) in 76% of samples, whether in MLL-AF4, MLL-ENL, or other MLL-R or 
MLL-G subsets, and regardless of patients' poor prognostic features. However, 
MLL status and partner genes correlated with EC50. Combined approaches including 
flow cytometry, Western blot, obatoclax treatment with death pathway inhibition, 
microarray analyses, and/or electron microscopy indicated a unique killing 
mechanism involving apoptosis, necroptosis, and autophagy in MLL-AF4 ALL cell 
lines and primary MLL-R and MLL-G infant ALL cells. This in vitro obatoclax 
activity and its multiple killing mechanisms across molecular cytogenetic 
subsets provide a rationale to incorporate a similarly acting compound into 
combination strategies to combat infant ALL.

Mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) fusion genes arise from chromosomal translocations 
and induce acute myeloid leukemia through a mechanism involving transcriptional 
deregulation of differentiation and self-renewal programs. Progression of 
MLL-rearranged acute myeloid leukemia is associated with increased activation of 
Rac GTPases. Here, we demonstrate that MLL fusion oncogenes maintain 
leukemia-associated Rac activity by regulating Frat gene expression, 
specifically Frat2. Modulation of FRAT2 leads to concomitant changes in Rac 
activity, and transformation of Frat knockout hematopoietic progenitor cells by 
MLL fusions results in leukemias displaying reduced Rac activation and increased 
sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs. FRAT2 activates Rac through a signaling 
mechanism that requires glycogen synthase kinase 3 and DVL. Disruption of this 
pathway abrogates the leukemogenic activity of MLL fusions. This suggests a 
rationale for the paradoxical requirement of canonical Wnt signaling and 
glycogen synthase kinase 3 activity for MLL fusion oncogenicity and identifies 
novel therapeutic targets for this disease.

Upon analyzing 696 childhood B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia 
(BCP-ALL) cases, we identified the characteristics of CD66c expression. In 
addition to the confirmation of strong correlation with BCR-ABL positivity and 
hyperdiploid, we further observed that CD66c is frequently expressed in 
CRLF2-positive (11/15, p<0.01 against chimeric gene-negative) as well as 
hypodiploid cases (3/4), whereas it is never expressed in ETV6-RUNX1, MLL-AF4, 
MLL-AF9, MLL-ENL, and E2A-PBX1-positive cases. Although the expression of CD66c 
itself is not directly linked to the prognosis, the accompanying genetic 
abnormalities are important prognostic factors for BCP-ALL, indicating the 
importance of CD66c expression in the initial diagnosis of BCP-ALL.

Race and association with disease manifestations and mortality in scleroderma: a 
20-year experience at the Johns Hopkins Scleroderma Center and review of the 
literature.

Experience suggests that African Americans may express autoimmune disease 
differently than other racial groups. In the context of systemic sclerosis 
(scleroderma), we sought to determine whether race was related to a more adverse 
expression of disease. Between January 1, 1990, and December 31, 2009, a total 
of 409 African American and 1808 white patients with scleroderma were evaluated 
at a single university medical center. While the distribution by sex was 
virtually identical in both groups, at 82% female, African American patients 
presented to the center at a younger mean age than white patients (47 vs. 53 yr; 
p < 0.001). Two-thirds of white patients manifested the limited cutaneous subset 
of disease, whereas the majority of African American patients manifested the 
diffuse cutaneous subset (p < 0.001). The proportion seropositive for 
anticentromere antibody was nearly 3-fold greater among white patients, at 34%, 
compared to African American patients (12%; p < 0.001). Nearly a third of 
African American (31%) patients had autoantibodies to topoisomerase, compared to 
19% of white patients (p = 0.001). Notably, African American patients 
experienced an increase in prevalence of cardiac (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.6; 
95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3-2.2), renal (OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.2-2.1), 
digital ischemia (OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.4-2.2), muscle (OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.3-2.3), 
and restrictive lung (OR, 6.9; 95% CI, 5.1-9.4) disease. Overall, 700 (32%) 
patients died (159 African American; 541 white). The cumulative incidence of 
mortality at 10 years was 43% among African American patients compared to 35% 
among white patients (log-rank p = 0.0011). Compared to white patients, African 
American patients experienced an 80% increase in risk of mortality (relative 
risk [RR], 1.8; 95% CI, 1.4-2.2), after adjustment for age at disease onset and 
disease duration. Further adjustment by sex, disease subtype, and 
scleroderma-specific autoantibody status, and for the socioeconomic measures of 
educational attainment and health insurance status, diminished these risk 
estimates (RR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.0-1.6). The heightened risk of mortality persisted 
in strata defined by age at disease onset, diffuse cutaneous disease, 
anticentromere seropositivity, decade of care at the center, and among women. 
These findings support the notion that race is related to a distinct phenotypic 
profile in scleroderma, and a more unfavorable prognosis among African 
Americans, warranting heightened diagnostic evaluation and vigilant care of 
these patients. Further, we provide a chronologic review of the literature 
regarding race, organ system involvement, and mortality in scleroderma; we 
furnish synopses of relevant reports, and summarize findings.

Thalidomide (TLD) is used to treat erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL), multiple 
myeloma, aphthous ulceration and wasting syndrome in HIV patients. The API can 
be found in two crystalline habits known as α-TLD and β-TLD. The saturation 
solubility (Cs) and the dissolution profiles under non-sink and sink conditions 
of both polymorphs were assessed. In addition, mini-capsules containing α-TLD or 
β-TLD without excipients were orally given (10 mg/kg) to Wistar rats. An 
intravenous (i.v.) dose was also administrated (5 mg/kg). The Cs values for 
α-TLD and β-TLD were not significantly different (α = 56.2 ± 0.5 μg·mL-1; 
β = 55.2 ± 0.2 μg·mL-1). However, the dissolution profile of α-TLD presented the 
fastest rate and the largest extension of drug dissolution than that from β-TLD 
(80% in 4 h versus 55% in 4 h). The α-TLD provided a more favorable 
pharmacokinetic than the β-TLD (maximum plasma concentration - Cmax: 
5.4 ± 0.90 μg·mL-1versus 2.6 ± 0.2 μg·mL-1; area under the curve of the 
concentration-time profile from time zero to infinity - AUC0-∞: 
44.3 ± 8.8 μg·h·mL-1versus 33.9 ± 4.7 μg·h·mL-1; absolute bioavailability - F: 
92.2 ± 18.5% versus 70.5 ± 9.9%, respectively). Drug suppliers and 
pharmaceutical companies should strictly control the technological processes 
involved in the TLD API synthesis as well as in the production of the 
pharmaceutical dosage form in order to guarantee the inter-batch homogeneity and 
therefore, product compliance.

MLL gene rearrangement, cytogenetic 11q23 abnormalities, and expression of the 
NG2 molecule in infant acute myeloid leukemia.

To study prognostic factors in infant acute myeloid leukemia (AML), we analyzed 
44 children treated on Childrens Cancer Group protocols for MLL gene 
rearrangement by Southern blot, cytogenetic 11q23 abnormalities, and reactivity 
with monoclonal antibody 7.1. This antibody detects the human homologue of the 
rat NG2 chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan molecule, which has previously been 
reported to be expressed on human melanoma. NG2 has been found to be expressed 
on human leukemic blasts but not on other hematopoietic cells. In childhood AML, 
NG2 cell surface expression correlated with poor outcome and with some but not 
all 11q23 rearrangements. In childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia, NG2 
expression correlated with poor outcome and with balanced 11q23 translocations. 
In this study, 29 of 44 (66%) of infants with AML showed MLL rearrangement and, 
as expected, this group had a high incidence of French-American-British M4/M5 
morphology (22/29). Of the cases tested, 35.1% (13/37) were NG2 positive. All 
(13/13) NG2-positive cases were rearranged at MLL, whereas only 46% (11/24) of 
NG2-negative cases had MLL rearrangement. NG2 expression did not correlate with 
poor outcome (P = .31); there was a trend towards a worse outcome with MLL 
rearrangement (P = .13). Thus monoclonal antibody 7.1 does not detect all cases 
of MLL rearrangement in infant AML.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Ladislao de la Pascua described the spotted or lazarine 
leprosy for first time in 1844. Later on, Lucio and Alvarado studied and 
published it with the same names in 1852. Latapí re-discovered it in 1938 and 
reported it as 'Spotted' leprosy of Lucio in 1948. Frenken named it diffuse 
leprosy of Lucio and Latapí in 1963. Latapí and Chévez-Zamora explained that the 
fundamental condition of this variety of leprosy was a diffuse generalised 
cutaneous infiltration, naming it pure and primitive diffuse lepromatosis, upon 
which necrotising lesions develop, calling these lesions Fenómeno de Lucio or 
erythema necrotisans. A great number of histopathological reports have addressed 
the study of Lucio's phenomenon, and few about the histologic changes that take 
place in the course of diffuse lepromatous leprosy. The purpose of this work is 
to report the histologic findings observed in the study of 170 cutaneous 
biopsies of diffuse leprosy of Lucio and Latapí and 30 of Lucio's phenomenon.
METHODS: This is a retrospective study, which included the examination of 200 
biopsy skin specimens from 199 patients with diffuse leprosy at different course 
of the disease. These cases were diagnosed in Mexico from 1970 to 2004.
RESULTS: The histologic examination revealed a vascular pattern affecting all 
cutaneous vessels, characterised by five outstanding features: a) colonisation 
of endothelial cells by acid-fast bacilli, b) endothelial proliferation and 
marked thickening of vessel walls to the point of obliteration, c) angiogenesis, 
d) vascular ectasia, and e) thrombosis. Necrotising lesions seen in diffuse 
lepromatous leprosy displayed two histopathological patterns: one of them, 
non-inflammatory occlusive vasculopathy and, the other one, occlusive 
vasculopathy, leukocytoclastic vasculitis, large neutrophilic infiltrate and 
lobular panniculitis. The first appeared as a result of the course of the 
occlusive vasculopathy produced by the colonisation of endothelial cells by 
Mycobacterium leprae. The second, as a result of a previous occlusive 
vasculopathy plus a leprosy reaction which is considered here as variant of ENL.
CONCLUSIONS: Endothelial cell injury appears to be the main event in the 
pathogenesis of diffuse leprosy of Lucio and Latapí. Once M. leprae has entered 
the endothelial cell, the micro-organism damages the blood vessels, leading to 
the specific changes seen in this variety of lepromatous leprosy.

Chromosomal rearrangements of the human MLL gene are a hallmark for aggressive 
(high-risk) pediatric, adult and therapy-associated acute leukemias. These 
patients need to be identified in order to subject these patients to appropriate 
therapy regimen. A recently developed long-distance inverse PCR method was 
applied to genomic DNA isolated from individual acute leukemia patients in order 
to identify chromosomal rearrangements of the human MLL gene. We present data of 
the molecular characterization of 414 samples obtained from 272 pediatric and 
142 adult leukemia patients. The precise localization of genomic breakpoints 
within the MLL gene and the involved translocation partner genes (TPGs) was 
determined and several new TPGs were identified. The combined data of our study 
and published data revealed a total of 87 different MLL rearrangements of which 
51 TPGs are now characterized at the molecular level. Interestingly, the four 
most frequently found TPGs (AF4, AF9, ENL and AF10) encode nuclear proteins that 
are part of a protein network involved in histone H3K79 methylation. Thus, 
translocations of the MLL gene, by itself coding for a histone H3K4 
methyltransferase, are presumably not randomly chosen, rather functionally 
selected.

The yeast two-hybrid system was used to identify binding partners of NuMA, a 
component of the nuclear matrix in interphase cells. By using the C-terminal 
half of NuMA as bait, a human cDNA sequence coding for a 223-amino acid protein 
with a non-helical N-terminal domain and a C-terminal alpha-helical portion was 
identified and fully sequenced. It was identical to GAS41, a sequence amplified 
in human gliomas. The sequence of the homologous Drosophila protein was 
established, and the alignment for GAS41 from nine different species showed that 
GAS41 is a general eukaryotic protein found in species as diverse as 
Arabidopsis, Drosophila, Caenorhabditis elegans, yeast, and man. Northern blot 
analysis showed a single transcript in eight human tissues. A polyclonal 
antibody to GAS41 showed a dotted staining pattern in interphase nuclei and a 
uniform distribution in mitotic cells. A GFP-GAS41 fusion protein displayed 
equivalent patterns. In vitro GAS41 bound to the C-terminal part of the rod 
region of NuMA, as shown by dot overlay and by surface plasmon resonance 
measurements. The K(d) of the complex was 2 x 10(-)(7) m. GAS41 is related to 
the AF-9 and ENL proteins, which are putative transcription factors found as 
fusion proteins in some acute leukemias. The NuMA/GAS41 interaction may provide 
a link between nuclear structure and gene expression.

Microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) is a basic 
helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper protein, and plays an important role in the 
development of various cell types, such as neural-crest-derived melanocytes and 
optic-cup-derived retinal pigment epithelium. Three isoforms of MITF with 
distinct amino-termini have been described. These include melanocyte 
lineage-specific MITF-M, heart-type MITF-H, and the recently identified MITF-A. 
Here we identify a fourth isoform, MITF-C, with a unique amino-terminus of 34 
amino acid residues, which shares about 43% sequence identity with putative 
transactivation segments of two previously identified leukemogenic factors, ENL 
and AF-9. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that 
MITF-C mRNA is expressed in many cell types, including retinal pigment 
epithelium, but is undetectable in melanocyte-lineage cells. In contrast, MITF-A 
and MITF-H mRNAs are coexpressed in all cell types examined. Transient 
cotransfection assays suggested that MITF-C, like other MITF isoforms, functions 
as a transcriptional activator of certain target genes, but its transactivation 
specificity for the target promoters is different from those of other MITF 
isoforms. Therefore, isoform multiplicity provides MITF with differential 
expression patterns as well as functional diversity.

We previously isolated cDNA clones, MLL-a and MLL-b, derived from the 11q23 
breakpoint region and detected gene rearrangements with MLL-b cDNA in infantile 
leukemia cell lines with 11q23 abnormalities. We also showed chimeric mRNAs 
between MLL and genes on partner chromosomes such as 4q21 and 19p13. In the 
present study, we isolated overlapping MLL cDNA clones of 11 kb and demonstrated 
that MLL-a and MLL-b were derived from the same gene, MLL/ALL-1/HRX. Northern 
analysis with an MLL cDNA probe detected different signals in t(11;19) cell 
lines, one being sized 10 kb in two cell lines, KOCL-33 and KOCL-44, and the 
other being 9.2 kb in the cell line, KOPN-1. To elucidate the molecular basis 
for the heterogeneity, we isolated cDNA clones of a translocation-associated 
gene on chromosome 19, LTG19, as well as chimeric cDNAs from KOPN-1. Northern 
analysis with LTG19 cDNA demonstrated the identical gene, encoding 
serine/proline rich 559 amino acid polypeptide, to be involved in all three cell 
lines. Sequence comparison revealed that the LTG19 portion of the predicted 
chimeric protein of KOPN-1 was fused in frame and contained the C-terminal 189 
amino acids. This was shorter by 366 amino acids than those of KOCL-33 and 
KOCL-44, also fused in frame. Reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis demonstrated 
complex chimeric mRNAs in cell lines and leukemia samples. Although a chimeric 
mRNA of KOPN-1 type was rare, its presence suggested that the shared C-terminal 
portion of 189 amino acids of LTG19 contains important signal(s) for malignant 
transformation.

Reactions, a relatively common phenomenon among leprosy patients in treatment, 
require early detection and proper management to prevent serious sequelae. It is 
generally accepted that reactional states are immunologically mediated and, as 
such, usually improve with immunomodulatory treatments such as corticosteroids 
or thalidomide. Neopterin, a product of gamma-interferon-activated macrophages, 
is a marker for cell-mediated immune activation and may be useful to detect 
reactional states in leprosy. Here, we compared neopterin levels in single serum 
samples from leprosy patients with and without reaction with untreated controls 
and, when available, serial samples among patients with and without reaction. 
Levels in the single sample measurements, conducted in 22 patients with a 
reversal reaction (mean 14.5 nmol l(-1), S.D. 8.7) and 13 with erythema nodosum 
leprosum (mean 16.9 nmol l(-1), S.D. 13.6), were significantly higher (P=0.02 
and P=0.001, respectively) than levels in 26 untreated patients (mean 9.1 nmol 
l(-1), S.D. 7.3). Values above the upper limit of normal (10 nmol l(-1)) were 
found in seven of 26 untreated patients, 14 of the 22 reversal reaction patients 
(P=0.01) and 10 of the 13 ENL patients (P=0.003). Serial serum samples, obtained 
from six patients that developed reactions and 14 that remained free of 
reaction, indicated that reversal reaction or erythema nodosum leprosum 
paralleled a concomitant increase in the serum neopterin level. Neopterin levels 
generally declined upon corticosteroid therapy. Neopterin may be a useful marker 
for reactional states in leprosy by providing a laboratory parameter to assess 
the onset, progression, response to therapy and resolution.

The essential actin-binding factor profilin-1 (Pfn1) is a non-classical tumor 
suppressor with the abilities toboth inhibit cellular proliferation and augment 
chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. Besides actin, Pfn1 interacts with proteins 
harboring the poly-L-proline (PLP) motifs. Our recent work demonstrated that 
both nuclear localization and PLP-binding are required for tumor growth 
inhibition by Pfn1, and this is at least partially due to Pfn1 association with 
the PLP-containing ENL protein in the Super Elongation Complex (SEC) and the 
transcriptional inhibition of pro-cancer genes. In this paper, by identifying a 
phosphorylation event of Pfn1 at Ser71 capable of inhibiting its actin-binding 
and nuclear export, we provide in vitro and in vivo evidence that 
chemotherapy-induced apoptotic sensitization by Pfn1 requires its cytoplasmic 
localization and actin-binding. With regard to tumor growth inhibition byPfn1, 
our data indicate a requirement for dynamic actin association and dissociation 
rendered by reversible Ser71phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. Furthermore, 
genetic and pharmacological experiments showed that Ser71 of Pfn1 can be 
phosphorylated by protein kinase A (PKA). Taken together, our data provide novel 
mechanistic insights into the multifaceted anticancer activities of Pfn1 and how 
they are spatially-defined in the cell and differentially regulated by 
ligand-binding.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical value of multiplex nested reverse 
transcription PCR (RT-nPCR) in screening acute myeloid leukemia(AML)fusion 
genes.
METHODS: A novel multiplex RT-nPCR assay was developed to detect 16 AML-related 
fusion genes (AML1-EVI1, AML1-ETO, AML1-MDS1, AML1-MTG16, MLL-AF9, MLL-AF6, 
MLL-AF10, MLL-ENL, MLL-MLL, PML-RARα, PLZFRARα, NPM1-RARα, CBFB-MYH11, DEK-CAN, 
SET-CAN and TLS-ERG) according to 2008 WHO classification of AML. The chromosome 
reciprocal translocations of 356 AML cases were detected by multiplex RT-nPCR 
and karyotyping. The positive samples were further confirmed by split- out PCR 
and FISH.
RESULTS: The fusion genes were detected in 172 patients with the positive 
detection rate of 48.31%(172/356), which was higher than that of karyotyping 
(31.46%) (χ²=70.314, P<0.01). Multiplex RT-nPCR is superior to karyotyping and 
FISH in identifying the rare, cryptic chromosome translocation (χ²=96.074, 
P<0.01).
CONCLUSION: The multiplex RT-nPCR used in this study can quickly, effectively 
and accurately screen the fusion genes in AML patients, which can provide 
important evidence for assessing diagnosis and treatment, and also provide 
necessary information for minimal residual disease (MRD) and prognosis.

Saccharomyces cerevisiae Yaf9p and the mammalian leukemia-associated protein ENL 
share a high degree of similarity. To investigate the biological function of 
Yaf9p, this protein was used to search for interacting proteins in a two-hybrid 
system. Here, we demonstrate that Yaf9p binds directly to Swc4p, the yeast 
homolog of the mammalian DNA-methyltransferase-associated protein 1. Yaf9p and 
Swc4p associate through C-terminal domains, and both proteins coprecipitate in 
vitro in pull-down experiments and in vivo by immunoprecipitation. In living 
cells, Swc4p is present in a megadalton protein complex that shows a 
fractionation behavior in gel filtration similar to that of Esa1p, the histone 
acetyltransferase of the NuA4 complex. Recruitment of Yaf9p to DNA leads to 
promoter-specific transcriptional activation that can be inhibited by dominant 
negative Swc4p lacking the Yaf9p binding domain. Interference with Swc4p 
function also increases sensitivity to the microtubule toxin benomyl, a trait 
that corresponds to the known phenotype of a yaf9(-) knockout strain. In 
summary, the results suggest that Yaf9p and Swc4p form a protein pair that has a 
role in chromatin modification with possible implications also for the function 
of their mammalian counterparts.

Mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) fuses with a variety of partners to produce a 
functionally altered MLL complex that is not expressed in normal cells, which 
transforms normal hematopoietic progenitors into leukemia cells. Because more 
than 80 fusion partners have been identified to date, the molecular functions of 
MLL fusion protein complexes appear diverse. However, over the past decade, the 
common functions utilized for leukemic transformation have begun to be 
elucidated. It appears that most (if not all) MLL fusion protein complexes 
utilize the AF4/ENL/P-TEFb and DOT1L complexes to some extent. Based on an 
understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms, several molecular 
targeting drugs are being developed, opening paths to novel therapies. Here, we 
review the recent progress made in identifying the molecular functions of 
various MLL fusions and categorize the numerous fusion partners into several 
functionally-distinct groups to help discern commonalities and differences among 
various MLL fusion protein complexes.

In pediatric acute leukemias, reciprocal chromosomal translocations frequently 
cause gene fusions involving the lysine (K)-specific methyltransferase 2A gene 
(KMT2A, also known as MLL). Specific KMT2A fusion partners are associated with 
the disease phenotype (lymphoblastic vs. myeloid), and the type of KMT2A 
rearrangement also has prognostic implications. However, the KMT2A partner gene 
cannot always be identified by banding karyotyping. We sought to identify such 
partner genes in 13 cases of childhood leukemia with uninformative karyotypes by 
combining molecular techniques, including multicolor banding FISH, 
reverse-transcriptase PCR, and long-distance inverse PCR. Of the KMT2A fusion 
partner genes, MLLT3 was present in five patients, all with acute lymphoblastic 
leukemia, MLLT1 in two patients, and MLLT10, MLLT4, MLLT11, and AFF1 in one 
patient each. Reciprocal reading by long-distance inverse PCR also disclosed 
KMT2A fusions with PITPNA in one patient, with LOC100132273 in another patient, 
and with DNA sequences not compatible with any gene in three patients. The most 
common KMT2A breakpoint region was intron/exon 9 (3/8 patients), followed by 
intron/exon 11 and 10. Finally, multicolor banding revealed breakpoints in other 
chromosomes whose biological and prognostic implications remain to be 
determined. We conclude that the combination of molecular techniques used in 
this study can efficiently identify KMT2A fusion partners in complex pediatric 
acute leukemia karyotypes. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Identification of MLL and chimeric MLL gene products involved in 11q23 
translocation and possible mechanisms of leukemogenesis by MLL truncation.

11q23 chromosome aberrations are frequently observed in infantile as well as 
therapy-related leukemias. The target gene at 11q23, MLL, is disrupted by the 
translocation and becomes fused to various translocation partner genes such as 
AF4/FEL, LTG9/AF9 and LTG19/ENL. The resulting chimeric mRNAs are fused in frame 
and have been predicted to encode leukemia-specific chimeric proteins. In the 
present study, we raised antibodies against MLL, LTG9 and LTG19 and demonstrated 
that MLL and chimeric MLL-LTG9 and MLL-LTG19 products are synthesized in vivo 
and are localized in the nuclei, using immunofluorescence and cell fractionation 
studies. The truncated N-terminal portion of the MLL product common to the 
various types of 11q23 translocation was also localized in the nuclei in a 
similar fashion. Murine 32Dc13 cells stably expressing the truncated N-terminal 
MLL protein exhibited an inhibition of differentiation and a growth advantage 
following stimulation by granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, although the 
IL-3 dependency was not significantly changed in comparison to the parental 
cells. These results suggest that the N-terminal portion common to various 
MLL-chimeric products plays an important role in leukemogenesis.

Prospective study on the relationship between intensive bactericidal therapy and 
leprosy reactions.

Groenen G, Janssens L, Kayembe T, Nollet E, Coussens L, Pattyn SR.

A systematic study was performed on the reactions occurring during several 
short-course therapy regimens for the treatment of paucibacillary and 
multibacillary patients. Most type 1 upgrading reactions in paucibacillary (PB) 
leprosy were mild to moderate and of short duration, while the time of onset was 
extremely variable. Their incidence was higher in the regimen rifampin (RMP) 900 
mg once weekly for ten weeks than when a single dose of RMP 40 mg/kg body weight 
was given or 1500 mg in one dose followed by one year of dapsone (DDS) 100 mg 
daily. In multibacillary (MB) leprosy, three regimens were compared: MB-WHO 
regimen; regimen C, consisting of daily RMP 600 mg, ethionamide (ETH) 500 mg, 
and DDS or clofazimine (CLO) 100 mg for six months, followed by six months of 
daily DDS or CLO; and regimen D, identical to regimen C but comprising daily DDS 
or CLO plus ETH 500 mg during the second semester. Type 1 upgrading reactions 
occurred more frequently in MB patients and were more severe than in PB 
patients. They occurred more frequently and were more severe in regimens C and D 
than in the MB-WHO regimen. CLO 100 mg daily prevented type 1 reactions in MB 
patients and rendered them less severe. ENL was also more frequent in regimens C 
and D and was not prevented by CLO in the dosage used. Although there is some 
correlation between type 1 reactions and the total amount of RMP administered, 
other aspects of RMP administration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Folate grafted and thiolated chitosan was synthesized and wrapped on the surface 
of mixed phosphatidylcholine based nanoliposomes (NLs) to improve the oral 
absorption and targeted pharmacological activity of anti-cancer drugs against 
breast cancer. In this study, a chitosan derived thiomer, having intrinsic 
properties of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) efflux pump inhibition, mucoadhesion and 
controlled drug release at a target site, was exploited to improve the 
performance of docetaxel (DTX) loaded NLs for better oral pharmacokinetics, 
targeted anti-cancer activity, liposomal stability and the physical 
characteristics of NLs. Thiomer enveloped nanoliposomes (ENLs) and bare 
nanoliposomes (NLs) were synthesized with the ingredient ratio pre-determined 
via Response Surface Methodology (RSM) plots by Design Expert® software. ENLs 
and NLs were thoroughly characterized for their surface chemistry, particle 
size, zeta potential, PDI, encapsulation efficiency, stability and release 
profile. ENLs were spherical in shape with a particle size of 328.5 ± 30 nm, a 
positive zeta potential of 18.81 ± 2.45 and a high encapsulation efficiency of 
83% for DTX. Controlled release of DTX from formulations was observed for over 
72 h for each formulation. The presence of thiol groups at the surface of the 
ENLs resulted in higher swelling and in situ gelling properties compared to the 
corresponding NLs. Furthermore, ENL/mucin mixtures showed a time dependent 
increase in viscosity for up to 12 h, leading to a 19.07-fold increased 
viscosity. Ex vivo permeation and P-glycoprotein inhibiting properties, studied 
in rat's small intestine, showed a 9.6-fold higher permeation and 13-fold 
enhancement of DTX in the presence of ENLs. In vitro cytotoxicity studies 
indicated that the ENLs can efficiently kill MD-MB-231 breast cancer cells with 
200 fold lower IC50 values than DTX alone as a positive control. The 
pharmacokinetic study revealed that the ENLs significantly improved the oral 
bioavailability of DTX i.e. up to 13.6 fold as compared to an aqueous dispersion 
of DTX. Therefore, these enveloped hybrid nanoliposomes (ENLs) have the 
potential to be developed as useful nanocarriers for efficient oral delivery and 
breast cancer management using DTX.

A subgroup of leukemogenic mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) fusion proteins (MFPs) 
including MLL-AF9 activates the Mecom locus and exhibits extremely poor clinical 
prognosis. Mecom encodes EVI1 and MDS1-EVI1 (ME) proteins via alternative 
transcription start sites; these differ by the presence of a PRDI-BF1-RIZ1 (PR) 
domain with histone methyltransferase activity in the ME isoform. Using an 
ME-deficient mouse, we show that ME is required for MLL-AF9-induced 
transformation both in vitro and in vivo. And, although Nup98-HOXA9, 
MEIS1-HOXA9, and E2A-Hlf could transform ME-deficient cells, both MLL-AF9 and 
MLL-ENL were ineffective, indicating that the ME requirement is specific to MLL 
fusion leukemia. Further, we show that the PR domain is essential for 
MFP-induced transformation. These studies clearly indicate an essential role of 
PR-domain protein ME in MFP leukemia, suggesting that ME may be a novel target 
for therapeutic intervention for this group of leukemias.

Three major types of rearrangements are involved in acute myeloid leukemias 
(AML): t(8;21)(q22;q22), inv(16)(p13q22), and 11q23/MLL abnormalities. Their 
precise identification becomes essential for diagnosis, prognosis, and 
therapeutic choices. Resulting fusion transcripts (FT) are also powerful markers 
for monitoring the efficacy of treatment, the minimal residual disease (MRD) and 
could become therapeutic targets. Today, the challenge is to propose an 
individual follow-up for each patient even for those with a rare fusion event. 
In this study, we propose a biochip-based assay integrated in a global strategy 
for identification of rare FT in AML, after fluorescence in situ hybridization 
detection, as described by the World Health Organization classification. Using 
cell lines, we developed and validated a biochip-based assay called the 
AMLFusionChip that identifies every FT of AML1-ETO, CBFbeta-MYH11 as well as 
MLL-AF9, MLL-ENL, MLL-AF6, and MLL-AF10. The original design of our 
AMLFusionChip.v01 enables the identification of these FT wherever the breakpoint 
on the partner gene may be. In case of biochip negative result, our 3'RACE 
amplification strategy enables to clone and then sequence the new translocation 
partner. This AMLFusionChip strategy fits into the concept of personalized 
medicine for the largest number of patients.

The study was aimed to investigate the fusion gene transcript and 
immunophenotypic characteristics of the mixed linage leukemia (MLL)-rearranged 
positive childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The incidence of MLL 
rearrangement in 601 cases of ALL patients was detected by the multiple-nested 
polymerase chain reaction (PCR); the subtypes and features of the fusion gene 
transcript were analyzed by PCR products sequencing; the immunophenotypic 
characteristics at diagnosis were compared between the 22 MLL rearrangement 
positive of ALL patient, 30 negative control which selected randomly from the 
patients whose fusion gene could not be detected in the same term and 43 
pro-B-ALL patients. The results showed that the incidence of MLL positive ALL 
was 3.66%, constituted 29.9% of the pro-B-ALL. The MLL rearrangement positive 20 
B-ALL patients were all CD10 negative; the number of patients who carried CD13, 
CD33 and CD34 was lower than that of pro-B-ALL who had no fusion gene, whereas 
the expression of CD20, CD22, CD2, CD5, CD7 showed no difference. 4 kind partner 
genes of MLL-AF4, AF9, AF10 and ENL were detected. The fusion loci of MLL gene 
were mainly located at the exon 6, 7, 8 and many kind of fusion loci of MLL may 
exist in one patient; whereas its partner gene fusion loci were relatively 
single. A transcript contains a random insert sequence existed in a transcript 
of one MLL-AF10+ patient. It is concluded that though incidence of MLL 
rearrangement is low, but it has a variety of fusion transcripts, the ALL 
patients has unique biological characteristics at immunophenotype and fusion 
transcript.

Institute of Hematology, Shenzhen 518035, China.

To study the incidence, the types of fusion genes and the clinical significance 
of rearrangements of mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene in acute leukemia (AL), 
the rearrangements of MLL gene of 60 patients with AL were detected by 
fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and 6 types of common fusion genes 
resulting from the rearrangements of MLL gene were detected by nested RT-PCR. 
The results showed that 7 out of 60 AL patients were found the rearrangements of 
MLL gene, the incidence of which was 11.67%. 2 out of 7 patients were diagnosed 
as AML-M(5), 5 patients were diagnosed as B-ALL. The fusion genes of the 2 
AML-M(5) patients who had the rearrangements of MLL gene were MLL/AF(9). Among 5 
B-ALL patients, 2 patients were confirmed to express MLL/ENL, 1 patient was 
confirmed to express MLL/AF(4), the other 2 patients did not express the fusion 
genes. It is concluded that FISH is a fast, specific and sensitive method to 
detect the rearrangements of MLL gene in AL patients and nested RT-PCR is a 
convenient and feasible method to detect the types of fusion genes resulting 
from the rearrangements of MLL gene. The detection of MLL gene rearrangement is 
of great importance in predicting prognosis and guiding therapy in AL.

Preventive effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors on nitrate 
tolerance during continuous transdermal application of nitroglycerin in patients 
with chronic heart failure.

This study was designed to investigate the effect of angiotensin-converting 
enzyme (ACE) inhibitors with and without a sulfhydryl group on intracellular 
production of cGMP, forearm blood flow, and neurohormonal factors during 
continuous transdermal application of nitroglycerin in patients with chronic 
heart failure. Platelet cGMP level and forearm blood flow were measured before 
and 5 min after sublingual administration of nitroglycerin (NTG) in 20 patients 
with chronic heart failure during the following 4 phases: (1) baseline phase; 
(2) NTG phase (1 week after NTG tape 10 mg/day); (3) CPT phase (1 week after 
both captopril 37.5 mg/day and NTG tape 10 mg/day); and (4) ENL phase (1 week 
after both enalapril 5 mg/day and NTG tape 10 mg/day). The platelet GMP level 
before sublingual NTG and forearm blood flow were significantly higher during 
the 3 phases with NTG tape than during the control phase. The percent increases 
in platelet cGMP level and forearm blood flow after sublingual NTG were 
significantly lower during the NTG phase than during the baseline phase. In 
contrast, concomitant application of ACE inhibitors maintained the percent 
increase in platelet cGMP level and forearm blood flow. These results indicate 
that concomitant therapy with ACE inhibitors may be helpful in preventing the 
attenuation of intracellular cGMP production in patients with chronic heart 
failure during continuous transdermal application of NTG.

Nerve function impairment in leprosy at diagnosis and at completion of MDT: a 
retrospective cohort study of 786 patients in Bangladesh.

This retrospective cohort study includes all new leprosy patients registered for 
multidrug therapy (MDT) in 1990 at the Danish-Bangladesh Leprosy Mission project 
in Bangladesh. The main objective was to determine the extent of nerve-function 
impairment (NFI) at diagnosis and at completion of MDT, and to identify 
opportunities for intervention and their relative impact on the prevention of 
disabilities (POD). A total of 786 patients were included; 486 males and 300 
females. There were 315 PB, and 471 MB patients. In terms of the WHO leprosy 
disability grading system, at the time of diagnosis 31/315 (9.8%) had grade 1 or 
grade 2 disability in the PB group, and 177/471 (37.6%) in the MB group. The 
incidence rate of NFI during MDT was 3.5 per 100 person years at risk (PYR) in 
the PB group, and 7.5 per 100 PYR in the MB group. In the MB group 37 (7.9%) 
previously normal patients sustained NFI during MDT, whilst 19 (4.0%) with NFI 
at diagnosis showed complete recovery at completion of MDT. The most commonly 
involved nerves were the ulnar (motor function) and the posterior tibial nerves 
(sensibility). Reversal reactions were observed in 0.6% of the PB patients 
during MDT, giving an incidence rate of 1 per 100 PYR. The percentage of MB 
patients diagnosed with reversal during MDT was 14.2%, giving an incidence rate 
of 6 per 100 PYR. The percentage of MB patients diagnosed with ENL during MDT 
was 2.1%, with an incidence rate of 1 per 100 PYR. It was concluded that early 
detection of new cases of leprosy would prevent disabilities in more than 30% of 
all patients, thus having the highest impact in the quest for the prevention of 
disabilities. POD activities during and after MDT will prevent disabilities in 
approximately 10% of all cases. This study also indicates that treatment with 
prednisolone is effective and should be available at field level for all 
patients with recent NFI.

Genitourinary system lymphomas comprise a small part of extra-nodal lymphomas 
(ENLs). ENLs of uterine origin are extremely rare and are often confused with 
gynecological malignancies. We present an 80-year-old female patient diagnosed 
with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) with a single focus of the uterus. 
The patient's only complaint was abnormal uterine bleeding. Magnetic resonance 
imaging revealed an intramural-subserous-submucous multiple mass lesion with 
minimal contrast enhancement mimicking leiomyosarcoma. Diffuse pathological 
18F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake was detected in the entire uterus corpus and 
cervix on positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scanning. 
The pathology of the endocervical and endometrial curettage material obtained 
was DLBCL; the patient was diagnosed with ENL, and a single focus was the 
uterus. ENLs should be considered in the differential diagnosis of gynecological 
malignancies in patients with abnormal uterine bleeding. PET/CT is crucial in 
showing metabolically active spread areas in these patients.

Infant acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with the mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) 
gene rearrangement (MLL-R) is considered a distinct leukemia from childhood or 
non-MLL-R infant ALL. To detect key genes and elucidate the molecular mechanisms 
of MLL-R infant ALL, microarray expression data were downloaded from the Gene 
Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) 
between MLL-R and non-MLL-R infant ALL were identified. Gene ontology (GO) and 
Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses were 
carried out. Then, we constructed a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network 
and identified the hub genes. Finally, drug-gene interactions were mined. A 
total of 139 cases of MLL-R infant ALL including 77 (55.4%) fusions with AF4, 38 
(27.3%) with ENL, 14 (10.1%) with AF9, and 10 (7.2%) other gene fusions were 
characterized. A total of 236 up-regulated and 84 down-regulated DEGs were 
identified. The up-regulated DEGs were mainly involved in homophilic cell 
adhesion, negative regulation of apoptotic process and cellular response to drug 
GO terms, while down-regulated DEGs were mainly enriched in extracellular matrix 
organization, protein kinase C signaling and neuron projection extension GO 
terms. The up-regulated DEGs were enriched in seven KEGG pathways, mainly 
involving transcriptional regulation and signaling pathways, and down-regulated 
DEGs were involved in three main KEGG pathways including Alzheimer's disease, 
TGF-beta signaling pathway, and hematopoietic cell lineage. The PPI network 
included 297 nodes and 410 edges, with MYC, ALB, CD44, PTPRC and TNF identified 
as hub genes. Twenty-three drug-gene interactions including four up-regulated 
hub genes and 24 drugs were constructed by Drug Gene Interaction database 
(DGIdb). In conclusion, MYC, ALB, CD44, PTPRC and TNF may be potential 
bio-markers for the diagnosis and therapy of MLL-R infant ALL.

This study was aimed to investigate the clinical value of multiplex nested 
reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) in detecting MLL-related fusion genes in 
myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Ten MLL-related genes (dupMLL, MLL-ELL, MLL-ENL, 
MLL-AF6, MLL-AF9, MLL-AF10, MLL-AF17, MLL-CBP, MLL-AF1P, MLL-AF1Q) in 221 MDS 
cases were detected by multiplex nested RT-PCR. The results indicated that 20 
patients were detected with positive result among 221 patients and the positive 
rate was 9.05%. The number of the positive cases and positive rates of the above 
mentioned 10 fusion genes were in order: 7 (3.16%), 2 (0.9%), 1 (0.45%), 1 
(0.45%), 2 (0.9%), 2 (0.9%), 1 (0.45%), 2 (0.9%), 1 (0.45%), 1 (10.45%). It is 
concluded that the multiplex nested RT-PCR has been confirmed to be able to 
detect 10 fusion genes in MDS patients, which can provide important evidences 
for assessing diagnosis and treatment, and give related necessary information 
about minimal residual disease and its prognosis.

The MLL (Mixed Lineage Leukaemia or Myeloid/Lymphoid Leukaemia) gene on 
chromosome 11q23 is frequently involved in chromosomal translocations associated 
with human acute leukaemias. These translocations lead to fusion genes generally 
resulting in novel chimeric proteins containing the amino terminus of MLL fused 
in-frame to one of about 30 distinct partner proteins. Abnormalities involving 
the MLL gene are observed in leukaemias of either lymphoid or myeloid lineage 
derivation, as well as in poorly differentiated or biphenotypic leukaemias. They 
are frequently seen in infant patients, and patients with therapy-related 
secondary AML following treatment with inhibitors of topoisomerase II 
(epipodophyllotoxins). In the majority of cases, abnormalities involving the MLL 
gene are associated with a very poor prognostic outcome. In this review, we will 
discuss some of the recent advances in MLL research resulting from biological as 
well as clinical studies.

This case presents a Caucasian girl diagnosed with early pre-B cell acute 
lymphoblastic leukemia at age 2 years. The only chromosomal anomaly detected in 
her bone marrow cells at this time was an add(12p). By age 4 years, she had a 
bone marrow and central nervous system (CNS) relapse of ALL and was treated with 
chemotherapy that included etoposide. She was in complete remission for 2 years 
following chemotherapy with etoposide, but later developed therapy-related acute 
myeloid leukemia (t-AML). At this time, a t(11;19)(q23;p13.3) rearrangement was 
detected in her bone marrow cells. The AML relapsed again 1 year after 
allogeneic bone marrow transplant (BMT). The presence of a chromosome 11 
abnormality involving band 11q23 in this patient suggests that the 
transformation from ALL to t-AML was a consequence of etoposide included in her 
chemotherapy. Studies have shown that the 11q23 breakpoint in the t(11;19) 
rearrangement is consistent, and involves the MLL gene in t-AML patients. 
However, the breakpoint in 19p is variable in that it could be located either at 
19p13.1 or 19p13.3 and thus could involve either of two genes: ELL (11-19 
lysine-rich leukemia gene) on 19p13.1 or ENL (11-19 leukemia gene) on 19p13.3. 
In this study, the t(11;19)(q23;p13.3) was further characterized and the 
breakpoint regions were defined by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) 
analysis.

    Leuk Lymphoma. 2020 Jul;61(7):1775.

This study aimed to develop a novel multiplex reverse transcription-nested 
polymerase chain reaction (RT-nPCR) assay to accurately and effectively detect 
10 common gene rearrangements in adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and to 
examine the clinicopathologic characteristics and other genetic aberrations of 
patients with ALL expressing different fusion genes. Our RT-nPCR assay had a 
positive detection rate of 35.15% (90/256) for the 10 fusion genes. BCR-ABL1, 
FUS-ERG, MLL-AF4, ETV6-RUNX1, E2A-PBX1, dupMLL, MLL-AF10, MLL-ENL, SET-NUP214 
and SIL-TAL1 were detected in 36 (14.06%), 14 (5.47%), 14 (5.47%), four (1.56%), 
four (1.56%), five (1.95%), four (1.56%), two (0.78%), two (0.78%) and five 
patients (1.95%), respectively. The RT-nPCR results were further confirmed by 
split-out PCR, and cytogenetic and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) 
analysis revealed corresponding translocations and fusions in 63 and 74 cases, 
respectively. JAK2 and IKZF1 mutations were commonly detected in patients with 
BCR-ABL1 ALL, and HOX overexpression was highly correlated with MLL fusions and 
SET-NUP214. This study demonstrates that RT-nPCR is an effective method for 
identifying 10 gene rearrangements in adult ALL, and it could potentially be 
developed for diagnostic use and prognostic studies of ALL.

Erythema nodosum leprosum is an acute inflammatory event in the chronic course 
of leprosy. It is considered an immunological disorder and an important cause of 
morbidity and disability. We evaluate the clinical profile, serology and 
histopathology 58 erythema nodosum leprosum patients sequentially recruited, 
from July- December 2000, in an endemic area in Central Brazil (Goiás State). 
Half of the reactins were considered severe and 66% of the cases had the first 
episode of reaction during specific treatment. The majority of patients and 
controls were positive to anti-PGL-I IgM. The more frequent histopathological 
findings in erythema nodosum leprosum were presence of intracellular acid-fast 
bacilli, perivascular/peradnexial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate, and 
neural aggression. Ninety six percent of the patients were treated with systemic 
steroid in the first episode. The results point out to the association between

We have used the hematopoietic system as a model to investigate whether acute 
myeloid leukemia arises exclusively from self-renewing stem cells or also from 
short-lived myeloid progenitors. When transduced with a leukemogenic MLL fusion 
gene, prospectively isolated stem cells and myeloid progenitor populations with 
granulocyte/macrophage differentiation potential are efficiently immortalized in 
vitro and result in the rapid onset of acute myeloid leukemia with similar 
latencies following transplantation in vivo. Regardless of initiating cell, 
leukemias displayed immunophenotypes and gene expression profiles characteristic 
of maturation arrest at an identical late stage of myelomonocytic 
differentiation, putatively a monopotent monocytic progenitor stage. Our 
findings unequivocally establish the ability of transient repopulating 
progenitors to initiate myeloid leukemias in response to an MLL oncogene, and 
support the existence of cancer stem cells that do not necessarily overlap with 
multipotent stem cells of the tissue of origin.

A nuclear protein with sequence similarity to proteins implicated in human acute 
leukemias is important for cellular morphogenesis and actin cytoskeletal 
function in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

Berkeley 94720.

The cellular functions of the product of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae ANC1 
(actin non-complementing) gene were investigated. ANC1 was previously identified 
in a screen for mutations that enhance the defect caused by a mutation in the 
actin gene. Here, we show that anc1-1 and anc1 delta 1::HIS3 (gene deletion) 
mutants exhibit a novel combination of defects in the organization of the actin 
cytoskeleton and the localization of Spa2p, a protein implicated in polarity 
development and cytokinesis. Morphological abnormalities exhibited by anc1 
mutants include failure to form a mating projection in response to alpha-factor 
and development of swollen or elongated cell shapes during proliferation. These 
morphological aberrations correlate with cytoskeletal defects that were also 
observed. These phenotypes demonstrate that Anc1p is important for actin 
function and for the functions of other proteins involved in morphogenesis. In 
further support of these roles for Anc1p, the anc1 delta 1::HIS3 mutation was 
found to be synthetically lethal in combination with a null mutation in SLA1, a 
gene that is important for membrane cytoskeleton function. Surprisingly, Anc1p 
was found to be a nuclear protein and to have sequence similarity to the human 
proteins ENL and AF-9. These human proteins are implicated in the development of 
a subset of acute lymphoblastic leukemias, acute myeloid leukemias, and 
lymphomas. Our findings suggest that changes in the functions or organization of 
actin filaments might contribute to the establishment of the neoplastic state 
for these leukemias and lymphomas.

Polycomb group (PcG) proteins control the timing of puberty by repressing the 
Kiss1 gene in hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARC) neurons. Here we identify two 
members of the Trithorax group (TrxG) of modifiers, mixed-lineage leukemia 1 
(MLL1), and 3 (MLL3), as central components of an activating epigenetic 
machinery that dynamically counteracts PcG repression. Preceding puberty, MLL1 
changes the chromatin configuration at the promoters of Kiss1 and Tac3, two 
genes required for puberty to occur, from repressive to permissive. 
Concomitantly, MLL3 institutes a chromatin structure that changes the functional 
status of a Kiss1 enhancer from poised to active. RNAi-mediated, ARC-specific 
Mll1 knockdown reduced Kiss1 and Tac3 expression, whereas CRISPR-Cas9-directed 
epigenome silencing of the Kiss1 enhancer selectively reduced Kiss1 activity. 
Both interventions delay puberty and disrupt reproductive cyclicity. Our results 
demonstrate that an epigenetic switch from transcriptional repression to 
activation is crucial to the regulatory mechanism controlling the timing of 
mammalian puberty.

The advent of CD19-specific chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells has proven 
to be a powerful asset in the arsenal of cancer immunotherapy of acute 
lymphoblastic leukemia and certain B cell lymphomas. However, a sizable portion 
of patients treated with CD19-CAR T cells relapse with CD19-negative cancer 
cells, necessitating the quest for back-up antigens. Chondroitin sulfate 
proteoglycan 4 (CSPG4) expression has been reported on leukemic blasts bearing 
the ill-fated MLL 11q23 rearrangement. We aimed at exploring the use of 
CSPG4-specific CAR T cells against mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL)-rearranged 
leukemic blasts, using the precursor B cell leukemia cell line KOPN8 (MLL-MLLT1 
translocation) as a model. First, we confirmed CSPG4 expression on KOPN8 cells. 
Bulk T cells electroporated with mRNA encoding a CSPG4-specific CAR upregulated 
activation markers and secreted the Th1 cytokines TNF and IFNγ in an 
antigen-specific manner upon co-culture with KOPN8 cells. More importantly, 
CSPG4-specific CAR T cells evinced specific degranulation towards KOPN8 cells 
and specifically lysed KOPN8 target cells in chromium lysis experiments. CSPG4 
is a well-established CAR target in cutaneous melanoma. Here, we provide 
proof-of-principle data for the use of CSPG4-specific CAR T cells against 
MLL-translocated leukemias.

Mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene rearrangements characterize approximately 70% 
of infant and 10% of adult and therapy-related leukemia. Conventional clinical 
diagnostics, including cytogenetics and fluorescence in situ hybridization 
(FISH) fail to detect MLL translocation partner genes (TPG) in many patients. 
Long-distance inverse (LDI)-PCR, the "gold standard" technique that is used to 
characterize MLL breakpoints, is laborious and requires a large input of genomic 
DNA (gDNA). To overcome the limitations of current techniques, a targeted 
next-generation sequencing (NGS) approach that requires low RNA input was 
tested. Anchored multiplex PCR-based enrichment (AMP-E) was used to rapidly 
identify a broad range of MLL fusions in patient specimens. Libraries generated 
using Archer FusionPlex Heme and Myeloid panels were sequenced using the 
Illumina platform. Diagnostic specimens (n = 39) from pediatric leukemia 
patients were tested with AMP-E and validated by LDI-PCR. In concordance with 
LDI-PCR, the AMP-E method successfully identified TPGs without prior knowledge. 
AMP-E identified 10 different MLL fusions in the 39 samples. Only two specimens 
were discordant; AMP-E successfully identified a MLL-MLLT1 fusion where LDI-PCR 
had failed to determine the breakpoint, whereas a MLL-MLLT3 fusion was not 
detected by AMP-E due to low expression of the fusion transcript. Sensitivity 
assays demonstrated that AMP-E can detect MLL-AFF1 in MV4-11 cell dilutions of 
10-7 and transcripts down to 0.005 copies/ng.Implications: This study 
demonstrates a NGS methodology with improved sensitivity compared with current 
diagnostic methods for MLL-rearranged leukemia. Furthermore, this assay rapidly 
and reliably identifies MLL partner genes and patient-specific fusion sequences 
that could be used for monitoring minimal residual disease. Mol Cancer Res;

5-10% of human acute leukemias carry chromosomal translocations involving the 
mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene that result in the expression of chimeric 
protein fusing MLL to >80 different partners of which AF4, ENL and AF9 are the 
most prevalent. In contrast to many other leukemia-associated mutations, several 
MLL-fusions are powerful oncogenes that transform hematopoietic stem cells but 
also more committed progenitor cells. Here, I review different approaches that 
were used to express MLL fusions in the murine hematopoietic system which often, 
but not always, resulted in highly penetrant and transplantable leukemias that 
closely phenocopied the human disease. Due to its simple and reliable nature, 
reconstitution of irradiated mice with bone marrow cells retrovirally expressing 
the MLL-AF9 fusion became the most frequently in vivo model to study the biology 
of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). I review some of the most influential studies 
that used this model to dissect critical protein interactions, the impact of 
epigenetic regulators, microRNAs and microenvironment-dependent signals for MLL 
fusion-driven leukemia. In addition, I highlight studies that used this model 
for shRNA- or genome editing-based screens for cellular vulnerabilities that 
allowed to identify novel therapeutic targets of which some entered clinical 
trials. Finally, I discuss some inherent characteristics of the widely used 
mouse model based on retroviral expression of the MLL-AF9 fusion that can limit 
general conclusions for the biology of AML. This article is part of a Special 
Issue entitled: The MLL family of proteins in normal development and disease

BACKGROUND: Quantification of the optic nerve sheath diameter is a promising 
approach for the detection of elevated intracranial pressure. The comparability 
of current methods is unclear. The objective of this study was to assess the 
relationship between optic nerve sheath diameter as measured with computed 
tomography, magnetic resonance tomography and ultrasound in patients without 
known optic nerve disease or increased intracranial pressure.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: 15 patients (60.8 [years]±16.73 SD; 7 female) with 
paranasal sinus pathology in whom computed tomography and magnetic resonance 
imaging were performed underwent optic nerve sheath diameter measurements by 
ultrasound, as well as an ophthalmological examination. Ultrasound-, computed 
tomography- and magnetic resonance imaging-derived maximal optic nerve sheath 
diameter values 3 mm behind the globe were compared.
RESULTS: Optic nerve sheath diameter measured (n=30) by ultrasound (mean 6.2 
[mm]±0.84 SD) was significantly (p<0.01) higher than optic nerve sheath diameter 
in computed tomography (5.2±1.11) or magnetic resonance imaging (5.3±1.14). 
There was no significant (p=0.24) difference between optic nerve sheath diameter 
measured in computed tomography and magnetic resonance tomography.
CONCLUSIONS: The comparability of optic nerve sheath diameter measurements in 
patients without known optic nerve disease and assumed normal intracranial 
pressure appears to be given between computed tomography and magnetic resonance 
tomography, while comparability between ultrasound and computed tomography or 
magnetic resonance tomography seems to be less reliable.

The MYO1F, unconventional myosin type 1F, gene is fused to MLL in infant acute 
monocytic leukemia with a complex translocation involving chromosomes 7, 11, 19 
and 22.

We analysed a complex translocation involving chromosomes 7, 11, 19 and 22 in 
infant acute monocytic leukemia, and identified that the MLL gene on 11q23 was 
fused to the unconventional myosin type 1F, MYO1F, gene on 19p13.2-13.3. MYO1F 
consists of at least 28 exons and was predicted to encode a 1098-amino-acid with 
an N-terminal head domain containing both ATP-binding and actin-binding 
sequences, a neck domain with a single IQ motif, and a tail with TH1, TH2 and 
SH3 domains. Northern blot analysis of RNAs prepared from multiple tissues 
showed that the expression of approximately 4-kb transcripts appeared constant 
in most tissues examined. However, MYO1F was expressed in only three of 22 
leukemic cell lines. The MLL-MYO1F fusion protein contains almost the entire 
MYO1F, however, C-terminal MYO1F has neither the transactivation domain nor the 
dimerization domain found in various MLL fusion partners. Further analysis of 
this novel type of MLL fusion protein would provide new insights into 
leukemogenesis. MYO1F is the fourth partner gene of MLL on 19p13. At the 
cytogenetic level, it may be difficult to distinguish MLL-ENL, MLL-ELL, MLL-EEN 
and MLL-MYO1F fusions created by t(11;19)(q23;p13), and it is likely that cases 
of t(11;19) lacking a known fusion gene may result in this gene fusion.

OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical and molecular biological characteristics of 
infant acute leukemia (IAL).
METHODS: R and/or G banding technique was used for analysis of karyotype. DNA 
blotting for HRX gene rearrangement, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and 
reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) for fusion gene detection.
RESULTS: Twenty cases of IAL were detected. HRX gene rearrangement was found in 
10 cases, including HRX/AF-4 fusion gene in 5, HRX/AF-9 fusion in 2, and HRX/ENL 
fusion in 1, HRX self-fusion mediated by alu-repeat homologous recombination and 
HRX/EEN fusion each in one (HRX/EEN is a novel fusion gene reported for the 
first time).
CONCLUSION: High frequency of HRX gene rearrangement occurred in IAL, which is 
characterised by a massive leukemia cell burden and 11q23 translocation, forming 
fusion genes, especially HRX/AF-4 (about 50%). The results are of important 
significance in guiding clinical treatment and approaching the etiology of IAL.

The MLL fusion partner AF10 binds GAS41, a protein that interacts with the human 
SWI/SNF complex.

E, Young BD.

Bartholomew's Hospital Medical College, London, United Kingdom.

The AF10 gene encodes a putative transcription factor containing an N-terminal 
LAP/PHD zinc finger motif, a functional nuclear localization signal, an AT-hook 
domain, and a leucine zipper toward the C-terminus. AF10 is involved in 2 
distinct chromosomal translocations associated with hematologic malignancy. The 
chimeric fusion proteins MLL/AF10 and CALM/AF10, resulting from the 
t(10;11)(p12;q23) and the t(10;11)(p12;q14), respectively, consistently retain 
the leucine zipper motif of AF10. This part of the C-terminal region was used as 
bait in a yeast 2 hybrid screening of a testis complementary DNA library. The 
leucine zipper interacted with GAS41, a protein previously identified as the 
product of an amplified gene in a glioblastoma. GAS41 shows significant homology 
to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein ANC1 and to the human MLL fusion 
partners AF9 and ENL. The interaction was confirmed in vivo. Furthermore, the 
study showed by coimmunoprecipitation that GAS41 interacts with INI1 (Integrase 
Interactor 1) and that INI1 was present in the AF10 immunoprecipitate. INI1 is 
the human homologue of the yeast SNF5 protein, a component of the SWI/SNF 
complex, which acts to remodel chromatin and to modulate transcription. The 
retention of the leucine zipper in the MLL and CALM fusions suggests that a key 
feature of these chimeric proteins may be their ability to interfere in normal 
gene regulation through interaction with the adenosine triphosphate-dependent 
chromatinremodeling complexes.

Kithul starch was treated by EN (energetic neutral nitrogen) atoms at 6 W,12 W 
and 18 W for 15 min and incorporated lauric acid for the development of 
starch-lauric acid inclusion complexes. EN atoms treatment significantly (p ≤ 
0.05) increased the complex index (CI). Severe morphological alterations on the 
kithul starch granules by EN atoms treatment enhanced starch-lauric acid complex 
formation. Relative crystallinity of EN atoms treated lauric acid incorporated 
kithul starch samples increased with plasma power. Moreover, lower pasting 
property, storage modulus (G'), loss modulus (G''), hardness and higher Tanδ 
indicated decrease in gelation and retrogradation property. ENL-18 W showed the 
lowest complex viscosity (Ƞ*). Lauric acid incorporation in EN atoms treated 
kithul starch reduced in vitro digestibility and significantly (p ≤ 0.05) 
increased RS (resistant starch). Hence, EN atoms treatment on the kithul starch 
granules prior to fatty acid incorporation is an effective technique for the 
development of starch-fatty acid complexes.

MLL leukemia and future treatment strategies.

Chromosomal rearrangements of the MLL gene are associated with high-risk infant, 
pediatric, adult, and therapy-induced acute leukemias. So far, about 80 
different direct MLL fusions and about 120 reciprocal MLL fusions have been 
characterized at the molecular level. The common theme in these 
leukemia-associated genetic rearrangements is the genetic disruption of the MLL 
gene. This leads to MLL-X fusion proteins that still bind to nuclear factors 
(e.g., MEN1, LEDGF), which in turn allow them to target promoters and cause 
ectopic gene transcription. In addition, the most frequent MLL fusions (MLL-AF4, 
MLL-AF9, MLL-AF10, and MLL-ENL) are all recruiting the wild-type AF4 
multiprotein complex that contains the target proteins P-TEFb, BRD4, and DOT1L. 
Vice versa, reciprocal X-MLL fusions exhibit a PHD domain (H3K4me3 reader 
domain), sequester the histone acetyltransferases CREBBP and MOF1 and bear a 
histone methyltransferase domain at their very C-terminus (SET domain). Except 
for AF4-MLL, the functional consequences deriving from reciprocal fusion 
proteins are not very well understood. However, based on our knowledge about the 
above-mentioned MLL fusions, it is reasonable to inhibit their oncogenic 
activity in a targeted fashion. Recent efforts in developing such inhibitors and 
their mode of action will be critically discussed.

MLL aberrations are detected in around 5-10% of acute myeloid and lymphatic 
leukemias and an additional 5% of acute myeloid leukemias show a partial 
internal MLL duplication (PTD). MLL rearrangements are important for therapy 
stratification, assessment of minimal residual disease and for targeted 
therapies. However, no truly evidence-based RT-PCR methods for the detection of 
most of these aberrations have been published yet. Based on the large data 
collection of MLL genomic breakpoints in acute leukemias comprising more than 
1.600 cases at the Diagnostic Center for Acute Leukemias (DCAL) in Frankfurt, 
Germany that provide an overview over the experimentally observed fusion 
transcript variants, we developed RT-PCR methods for the reliable detection of 
the 8 most common MLL aberrations (MLL-AF4, MLL-AF6, MLL-AF9, MLL-AF10, MLL-ENL, 
MLL-ELL, MLL-EPS15, MLL PTD), together accounting for around 90% of MLL-r cases. 
The easily implementable RT-PCRs should enable a reliable detection of these MLL 
fusion transcripts by RT-PCR.

The MYB oncogene is widely expressed in acute leukemias and is important for the 
continued proliferation of leukemia cells, suggesting that MYB may be a 
therapeutic target in these diseases. However, realization of this potential 
requires a significant therapeutic window for MYB inhibition, given its 
essential role in normal hematopoiesis, and an approach for developing an 
effective therapeutic. We previously showed that the interaction of c-Myb with 
the coactivator CBP/p300 is essential for its transforming activity. Here, by 
using cells from Booreana mice which carry a mutant allele of c-Myb, we show 
that this interaction is essential for in vitro transformation by the myeloid 
leukemia oncogenes AML1-ETO, AML1-ETO9a, MLL-ENL, and MLL-AF9. We further show 
that unlike cells from wild-type mice, Booreana cells transduced with AML1-ETO9a 
or MLL-AF9 retroviruses fail to generate leukemia upon transplantation into 
irradiated recipients. Finally, we have begun to explore the molecular 
mechanisms underlying these observations by gene expression profiling. This 
identified several genes previously implicated in myeloid leukemogenesis and HSC 
function as being regulated in a c-Myb-p300-dependent manner. These data 
highlight the importance of the c-Myb-p300 interaction in myeloid leukemogenesis 
and suggest disruption of this interaction as a potential therapeutic strategy 
for acute myeloid leukemia.

The fusion transcripts of MLL rearrangement [MLL(+)] in acute myeloid leukemia 
(AML) and their clinicohematologic correlation have not be well characterized in 
the previous studies. We used Southern blot analysis to screen MLL(+) in de novo 
AML. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was used to detect the 
common MLL fusion transcripts. cDNA panhandle PCR was used to identify 
infrequent or unknown MLL partner genes. MLL(+) was identified in 114 (98 
adults) of 988 AML patients. MLL fusion transcripts comprised of 63 partial 
tandem duplication of MLL (MLL-PTD), 14 MLL-AF9, 9 MLL-AF10, 9 MLL-ELL, 8 
MLL-AF6, 4 MLL-ENL and one each of MLL-AF1, MLL-AF4, MLL-MSF, MLL-LCX, MLL-LARG, 
MLL-SEPT6 and MLL-CBL. The frequency of MLL-PTD was 7.1% in adults and 0.9% in 
children (P<0.001). 11q23 abnormalities were detected in 64% of MLL/t11q23 and 
in none of MLL-PTD by conventional cytogenetics. There were no differences in 
remission rate, event-free survival and overall survival between adult MLL-PTD 
and MLL/t11q23 groups. Adult patients had a significantly poorer outcome than 
children. The present study showed that cDNA panhandle PCR can identify all rare 
or novel MLL partner genes. MLL-PTD was rare in childhood AML. MLL(+) adults had 
a poor outcome with no difference in survival between MLL-PTD and MLL/t11q23 
groups.

Leukemia stem cells are defined as transformed hematopoietic stem cells or 
committed progenitor cells that have amplified or acquired the stem cell 
capacity for self-renewal, albeit in a poorly regulated fashion. In this issue 
of Cancer Cell, Huntly and colleagues report a striking difference in the 
ability of two leukemia-associated fusion proteins, MOZ-TIF2 and BCR-ABL, to 
transform myeloid progenitor populations. This rigorous study supports the idea 
of a hierarchy among leukemia-associated protooncogenes for their ability to 
endow committed myeloid progenitors with the self-renewal capacity driving 
leukemic stem cell propagation, and sheds new light on the pathogenesis of 
chronic and acute myelogenous leukemias.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: In the last few years molecular methods have allowed 
the identification of leukemia-associated genetic lesions, which may represent 
the most accurate predictors of clinical outcome. These considerations 
strengthen the need for rapid identification of the abnormalities. Our aim was 
to demonstrate whether a modified multiplex reverse transcription polymerase 
chain reaction (RT-PCR) system might be successfully used to screen a large 
number of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).
DESIGN AND METHODS: In this study we adapted the multiplex RT-PCR assay, 
previously described by Pallisgaard et al., to detect all the most frequent 
genetic lesions with their characteristic splicing variants occurring in acute 
lymphoblastic leukemia, such as the MLL/AF4, MLL/ENL, BCR/ABL p190 (e1a2) and 
p210 (b2a2,b3a2) isoforms, E2A/PBX1, TEL/AML1, SIL/TAL1 and the novel 
NUP98/RAP1GDS1 transcript, recently described in a T-ALL leukemic subtype.
RESULTS: We used the multiplex RT-PCR assay to screen 170 ALL patients (70 
children and 100 adults). PCR positivity was detected in 67 (39%) of the 170 ALL 
patients studied. The comparison between cytogenetic and molecular analyses 
showed complete correspondence between the two assays in all patients with an 
evaluable karyotype. Finally, the observed incidence of genetic lesions in our 
ALL patients was similar to the frequency usually reported both in children and 
in adults with ALL.
INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: These results show that, compared to single 
RT-PCR reactions, our multiplex RT-PCR system allows rapid, specific, 
simultaneous as well as a less expensive, laborious and time-consuming detection 
of the most frequent fusion transcripts in ALL patients. Therefore, it might be 
recommended for rapid diagnostic molecular screening of large numbers of 
patients, such as those enrolled in multicenter, co-operative studies. 
Furthermore, we have shown that multiplex RT-PCR is an open system that can 
easily be adapted to detect new leukemic genes.

The MLL gene in chromosome band 11q23 is frequently rearranged in acute 
lymphoblastic and acute myeloid leukemias. To date, more than 50 different 
chromosomal regions are known to participate in translocations involving 11q23, 
many of which affect MLL. The pathogenetically important outcome of these 
rearrangements is most likely the creation of a fusion gene consisting of the 5' 
part of the MLL gene and the 3' end of the partner gene. Although abnormalities 
of the MLL gene as such are generally associated with poor survival, recent data 
suggest that the prognostic impact varies among the different fusion genes 
generated. Hence, detection of the specific chimeric gene produced is important 
for proper prognostication and clinical decision making. We have developed a 
paired multiplex reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis to 
facilitate a rapid and accurate detection of the most frequent MLL fusion genes 
in adult and childhood acute leukemias. To increase the specificity, two sets of 
primers were designed for each fusion gene, and these paired primer sets were 
run in parallel in two separate multiplex one-step PCR reactions. Using the 
described protocol, we were able to amplify successfully, in one single assay, 
the six clinically relevant fusion genes generated by the t(4;11)(q21;q23) 
[MLL/AF4], t(6;11)(q27;q23) [MLL/AF6], t(9;11)(p21-22;q23) [MLL/AF9], 
t(10;11)(p11-13;q23) [MLL/AF10], t(11;19)(q23;p13.1) [MLL/ELL], and 
t(11;19)(q23; p13.3) [MLL/ENL] in cell lines, as well as in patient material.

[Epidemiological immunological studies on leprosy in Okinawa. 6. Lepromin, 
lymphocyte transformation, FLA-ABS and leproagglutination tests in the in-and 
out-patients with leprosy and the relationships among these tests and personal 
or family history or clinical findings of the patients].

In- and out-patients with leprosy in Okinawa were surveyed by using the 
following immunological tests: cutaneous reaction to Mitsuda's lepromin (40 
million bacilli/ml) (LPR), lymphocyte transformation test with Dharmendara's 
antigen (DL-LTT), that with phytohemagglutinin (PHA-LTT), fluorescent leprosy 
antibody absorption test (FLA-ABS) and Leproagglutination test with 
cardiolipin-lecithin antigen (LAT). A correlation between two tests and a 
relationship between the test and personal or family history or clinical finding 
of the patients were evaluated by non-parametric statistics. Spearman's rank 
correlation coefficient was significant between LPR and DL-LTT, while a reverse 
correlation was found between LPR and FLA-ABS, DL-LTT and FLA-ABS, and DL-LTT 
and LAT, respectively. High reactivity in PHA-LTT was found in almost all of 
patients, irrespective of type and stage of leprosy, suggesting general immune 
responsiveness of leprosy patients in Okinawa. The other tests showed a 
significant difference in the mean rank of reaction values according to clinical 
findings such as type and stage of leprosy, property of skin lesion, loss of 
eyebrow, and bacteriological test. The use of LPR and DL-LTT for the study of 
cell-mediated immunity in leprosy was therefore confirmed. FLA-ABS was found 
useful for early serodiagnosis, while LAT for the study of autoimmunity in 
leprosy. None of these immunological tests showed significant difference among 
the subgroups of patients classified by the following items: presence or absence 
of consanguineous patient with leprosy, living place, place of onset, presence 
or absence of neural symptoms such as the enlargement of peripheral nerve, claw 
hand and facial palsy, ocular and nasal involvement, ENL in lepromatous and 
borderline leprosy and conditions in the treatment. On the other hand, LPR 
showed higher reactivity in female than in male, in the patients at home than 
those discharged, and in the patients with drop foot than those without. Higher 
reactivity of DL-LTT was also found in male than in female and in the patients 
with plantar ulcer than those without. FLA-ABS reactivity was significantly 
higher in the discharged patients than the inpatients, in the period of 5 to 9 
years after onset than that of 20 or more years, but the reactivity was lower in 
the patients with drop foot than those without. LAT reactivity was significantly 
higher in the 30-39 years old patients than 0-19 years old, and in the patients 
with physical work than those with mental.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

ELL family transcription factors activate the overall rate of RNA polymerase II 
(Pol II) transcription elongation by binding directly to Pol II and suppressing 
its tendency to pause. In metazoa, ELL regulates Pol II transcription elongation 
as part of a large multisubunit complex referred to as the Super Elongation 
Complex (SEC), which includes P-TEFb and EAF, AF9 or ENL, and an AFF family 
protein. Although orthologs of ELL and EAF have been identified in lower 
eukaryotes including Schizosaccharomyces pombe, it has been unclear whether 
SEC-like complexes function in lower eukaryotes. In this report, we describe 
isolation from S. pombe of an ELL-containing complex with features of a 
rudimentary SEC. This complex includes S. pombe Ell1, Eaf1, and a previously 
uncharacterized protein we designate Ell1 binding protein 1 (Ebp1), which is 
distantly related to metazoan AFF family members. Like the metazoan SEC, this S. 
pombe ELL complex appears to function broadly in Pol II transcription. 
Interestingly, it appears to have a particularly important role in regulating 
genes involved in cell separation.

The discovery of chromosomal translocations in leukemia/lymphoma and sarcomas 
presaged a widespread discovery in epithelial tumors. With the advent of 
new-generation whole-genome sequencing, many consistent chromosomal 
abnormalities have been described together with putative driver and passenger 
mutations. The multiple genetic changes required in mouse models to assess the 
interrelationship of abnormalities and other mutations are severe limitations. 
Here, we show that sequential gene targeting of embryonic stem cells can be used 
to yield progenitor cells to generate chimeric offspring carrying all the 
genetic changes needed for cell-specific cancer. Illustrating the technology, we 
show that MLL-ENL fusion is sufficient for lethal leukocytosis and proof of 
genome integrity comes from germline transmission of the sequentially targeted 
alleles. This accelerated technology leads to a reduction in mouse numbers 
(contributing significantly to the 3Rs), allows fluorescence tagging of 
cancer-initiating cells, and provides a flexible platform for interrogating the 
interaction of chromosomal abnormalities with mutations.

Epigenetic modifications of chromatin play an important role in the regulation 
of gene expression. KMT4/Dot1 is a conserved histone methyltransferase capable 
of methylating chromatin on Lys79 of histone H3 (H3K79). Here we report the 
identification of a multisubunit Dot1 complex (DotCom), which includes several 
of the mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) partners in leukemia such as ENL, AF9/MLLT3, 
AF17/MLLT6, and AF10/MLLT10, as well as the known Wnt pathway modifiers TRRAP, 
Skp1, and beta-catenin. We demonstrated that the human DotCom is indeed capable 
of trimethylating H3K79 and, given the association of beta-catenin, Skp1, and 
TRRAP, we investigated, and found, a role for Dot1 in Wnt/Wingless signaling in 
an in vivo model system. Knockdown of Dot1 in Drosophila results in decreased 
expression of a subset of Wingless target genes. Furthermore, the loss of 
expression for the Drosophila homologs of the Dot1-associated proteins involved 
in the regulation of H3K79 shows a similar reduction in expression of these 
Wingless targets. From yeast to human, specific trimethylation of H3K79 by Dot1 
requires the monoubiquitination of histone H2B by the Rad6/Bre1 complex. Here, 
we demonstrate that depletion of Bre1, the E3 ligase required for H2B 
monoubiquitination, leads specifically to reduced bulk H3K79 trimethylation 
levels and a reduction in expression of many Wingless targets. Overall, our 
study describes for the first time the components of DotCom and links the 
specific regulation of H3K79 trimethylation by Dot1 and its associated factors 
to the Wnt/Wingless signaling pathway.

Translocations involving 11q23 are among the most common genetic abnormalities 
in hematologic malignancies, occurring in approximately 5-10% of acute 
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 5% of acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML). In 
11q23 translocations, the mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene on chromosome 11, 
band q23, is usually disrupted. The human homologue of the rat NG2 chondroitin 
sulfate proteoglycan molecule, as detected by the monoclonal antibody (moab) 
7.1, was shown to be expressed on leukemic cells with MLL rearrangements of 
children with acute leukemia. We further investigated the reactivity of the moab 
7.1 on 533 cell samples of adults (n = 215) and children (n = 318) with acute 
leukemias (271 AML, 217 B-lineage ALL, 37 T-lineage ALL, eight CD7+ CD56+ 
myeloid/natural killer cell precursor acute leukemias) by flow cytometry. In 
AML, 38 samples were positive for moab 7.1 ('20%-cut-off-level'). These moab 
7.1-positive AML cases revealed a myelomonocytic-differentiated immunophenotype 
with coexpression of the NK cell marker CD56 in 33 of 38 cases. Two of eight 
cell samples of the recently described CD7+ CD56+ myeloid/natural killer cell 
precursor acute leukemia entity reacted with moab 7.1. In ALL, 35 samples mostly 
of the pro-B-ALL subtype (33 pro-B-ALL, one common-ALL, one pre-B-ALL) were 
positive for moab 7.1. 58 (81%) of 72 samples with MLL rearrangements were 
positive for moab 7.1 including 28/31 with a t(4;11), 16/17 with a t(9;11), 3/5 
with a t(11;19), and 2/6 with a del(11)(q23). All moab 7.1-positive ALL (n = 34) 
and childhood AML (n = 17) cases revealed MLL rearrangements as detected by 
Southern blot analysis and RT-PCR. However, 11 adults with AML, and one adult 
with moab 7.1-positive CD7+ CD56+ myeloid/natural killer cell precursor acute 
leukemia were negative for MLL rearrangements as proved by Southern blot 
analysis. We conclude that moab 7.1 is a sensitive but not entirely specific 
marker for the identification of 11q23-associated AML and ALL by flow cytometry 
in children and adults.

Effective systemic treatments for relapsed or refractory T-cell acute 
lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) are limited. Recent clinical application of 
chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) immunotherapy has demonstrated successful 
control of B-cell malignancies by CAR-T cells; however, designing CARs for T-ALL 
remains a challenge. CD7 overexpression in T-cell malignancies may be an 
attractive target for immunotherapy in T-ALL. This study aimed to describe the 
safe and effective use of autologous CD7-CAR T cells (4SCAR7) for the treatment 
of T-ALL with induction failure in an 11-year-old patient. Based on The Chinese 
Children's Cancer Group-ALL (CCCG-ALL) study protocol, minimal residual disease 
(MRD) by flow cytometry (FC) analysis was detected on days 19 and 46 of 
remission induction. At the end of remission-induction chemotherapy, the patient 
achieved morphologic complete remission, though with MRD 16.13% and RT-PCR of 
KMT2A-MLLT1 fusion positive, which indicated induction failure. The 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was negative for blasts at diagnosed. CAR-T therapy 
and allogeneic transplant were recommended as the next treatment options. CD3+ 
lymphocytes were collected from the patient 18 days after the high-dose MTX 
chemotherapy through leukapheresis. The 4SCAR7 CD7-targeting CAR-T cells were 
generated thereafter. The patient received lymphodepleting chemotherapy prior to 
4SCAR7 infusion. Oral administration of itraconazole and sulfamethoxazole was 
performed from day 0 after CAR-T cell infusion. The patient did not have 
hypotension, hypoxia, or serious biochemical change or abnormality, but had 
fever on day 9. Although grade 1 cytokine-release syndrome (CRS) was diagnosed, 
it was successfully treated with ibuprofen. Anti-CD7 CAR transgene copy numbers 
in peripheral blood were determined by qPCR, which showed effective expansion 
initially, then dropped quickly, and persisted at a low level. Although 
experienced cytopenia from days 14 to 21, the patient achieved remission on day 
17. After complete remission, the patient received hematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation (HSCT) and has recovered well to thisdate. Overall, this report 
suggested that 4SCAR7 could be a safe and effective strategy for the treatment 
of pediatric patients with high-risk T-cell malignancies.

OBJECTIVE: MLL gene is involved in more than 80 known genetic fusions in acute 
leukemia. To study the relevance of MLL partner gene and selected gene's 
expression, in this work, we have studied a cohort of 20 MLL-rearranged acute 
myeloid leukemia (AML).
METHODS: Twenty MLL-rearranged AML patients along with a control cohort of 138 
AML patients are included in this work. By RT-PCR and sequencing, MLL genetic 
fusion was characterized, and relative gene expression quantification was 
carried out for EVI1, MEIS1, MLL-3', RUNX1, SETBP1, HOXA5, and FLT3 genes. Risk 
stratification and association of MLL genetic partner and gene expression to 
overall survival, in the context of received therapy, were performed.
RESULTS: MLLr cohort showed to have an OS more similar to intermediate-risk AML. 
Type of MLL genetic partner showed to be relevant in allo-HSCT response; having 
MLLT1 and MLLT3, a better benefit from it. Expression of MLL-3' region, EVI1 and 
FLT3, showed association with OS in patients undergoing allo-HSCT.
CONCLUSION: We show that the MLL genetic partner could have implications in 
allo-HSCT response, and we propose three genes whose expression could be useful 
for the prognosis of this leukemia in patients undergoing allo-HSCT: 3' region 
of MLL, EVI1, and FLT3.

Mixed lineage leukemia 1 (MLL1, also known as MLL or KMT2A) is an important 
transcription factor and histone-H3 lysine-4 (H3K4) methyltransferase. It is a 
master regulator for transcription of important genes (e.g., Hox genes) for 
embryonic development and hematopoiesis. However, it is largely dispensable in 
matured cells. Dysregulation of MLL1 leads to overexpression of certain Hox 
genes and eventually leukemia initiation. Chromosome translocations involving 
MLL1 cause ~ 75% of acute leukemia in infants and 5-10% in children and adults 
with a poor prognosis. Targeted therapeutics against oncogenic fusion MLL1 
(onco-MLL1) are therefore needed. Onco-MLL1 consists of the N-terminal 
DNA-interacting domains of MLL1 fused with one of > 70 fusion partners, among 
which transcription cofactors AF4, AF9 and its paralog ENL, and ELL are the most 
frequent. Wild-type (WT)- and onco-MLL1 involve numerous protein-protein 
interactions (PPI), which play critical roles in regulating gene expression in 
normal physiology and leukemia. Moreover, WT-MLL1 has been found to be essential 
for MLL1-rearranged (MLL1-r) leukemia. Rigorous studies of such PPIs have been 
performed and much progress has been achieved in understanding their structures, 
structure-function relationships and the mechanisms for activating gene 
transcription as well as leukemic transformation. Inhibition of several critical 
PPIs by peptides, peptidomimetic or small-molecule compounds has been explored 
as a therapeutic approach for MLL1-r leukemia. This review summarizes the 
biological functions, biochemistry, structure and inhibition of the critical 
PPIs involving MLL1 and its fusion partner proteins. In addition, challenges and 
perspectives of drug discovery targeting these PPIs for the treatment of MLL1-r 
leukemia are discussed.

Gene rearrangements generate MLL fusion genes, which can lead to aggressive 
leukemia. In most cases, MLL fuses with a gene encoding a component of the AEP 
(AF4 family/ENL family/P-TEFb) coactivator complex. MLL-AEP fusion proteins 
constitutively activate their target genes to immortalize haematopoietic 
progenitors. Here we show that AEP and MLL-AEP fusion proteins activate 
transcription through selectivity factor 1 (SL1), a core component of the 
pre-initiation complex (PIC) of RNA polymerase I (RNAP1). The pSER domain of AF4 
family proteins associates with SL1 on chromatin and loads TATA-binding protein 
(TBP) onto the promoter to initiate RNA polymerase II (RNAP2)-dependent 
transcription. These results reveal a previously unknown transcription 
initiation mechanism involving AEP and a role for SL1 as a TBP-loading factor in 
RNAP2-dependent gene activation.

MLL-AF4 fusion is a hallmark genetic abnormality in infant B-acute lymphoblastic 
leukemia (B-ALL) known to arise in utero. The cellular origin of leukemic fusion 
genes during human development is difficult to ascertain. The bone marrow (BM) 
microenvironment plays an important role in the pathogenesis of several 
hematological malignances. BM mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSC) from 38 children 
diagnosed with cytogenetically different acute leukemias were screened for 
leukemic fusion genes. Fusion genes were absent in BM-MSCs of childhood 
leukemias carrying TEL-AML1, BCR-ABL, AML1-ETO, MLL-AF9, MLL-AF10, MLL-ENL or 
hyperdiploidy. However, MLL-AF4 was detected and expressed in BM-MSCs from all 
cases of MLL-AF4(+) B-ALL. Unlike leukemic blasts, MLL-AF4(+) BM-MSCs did not 
display monoclonal Ig gene rearrangements. Endogenous or ectopic expression of 
MLL-AF4 exerted no effect on MSC culture homeostasis. These findings suggest 
that MSCs may be in part tumor-related, highlighting an unrecognized role of the 
BM milieu on the pathogenesis of MLL-AF4(+) B-ALL. MLL-AF4 itself is not 
sufficient for MSC transformation and the expression of MLL-AF4 in MSCs is 
compatible with a mesenchymal phenotype, suggesting a differential impact in the 
hematopoietic system and mesenchyme. The absence of monoclonal rearrangements in 
MLL-AF4(+) BM-MSCs precludes the possibility of cellular plasticity or 
de-differentiation of B-ALL blasts and suggests that MLL-AF4 might arise in a 
population of prehematopoietic precursors.

The HRX proto-oncogene product is widely expressed in human tissues and 
localizes to nuclear structures.

Chromosomal rearrangement of the HRX (MLL, ALL-1, Htrx) gene situated at 
chromosome band 11q23 is one of the most frequent genetic changes in infant 
leukemias of myeloid and lymphoid lineage and in treatment-induced secondary 
leukemias. The HRX gene codes for a predicted 431-kD protein that shows 
significant homology to the Drosophila trithorax protein, an Hox epigenetic 
regulator. Typically, the region encoding the HRX gene is rearranged, mostly in 
reciprocal translocations with a number of partners, resulting in a range of 
fusion genes. However, this is not the only abnormality affecting HRX because 
partial duplication of the gene, as well as interstitial deletions, can occur. 
Despite extensive studies of HRX at the genetic level, the protein products of 
the HRX gene and their patterns of expression in normal and leukemic cells 
remain uncharacterized. In this study we analyzed the distribution and 
localization of HRX proteins in cell lines and human tissues, using both 
polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies. The specificity of these reagents was 
confirmed using cells transfected with the HRX-ENL fusion gene. Western blot 
analyses of protein extracts from cells carrying the t(11;19) and t(4;11) 
translocations showed HRX chimeric proteins whose migrations corresponded to the 
sizes predicted from analyses of translocation-induced fusion mRNAs expressed by 
the derivative 11 chromosomes. Immunocytochemical analysis showed a punctate 
distribution of wild-type and chimeric HRX proteins within cell nuclei, 
suggesting that HRX localizes to nuclear structures in cells with and without 
11q23 translocations. Nuclear staining was found in the majority of tissues 
studied with the strongest reactivity in cerebral cortex, kidney, thyroid, and 
lymphoid tissues. Thus, HRX is widely expressed in most cell types including 
hematopoietic cells, a finding that precludes an immunocytochemical approach for 
diagnosis of leukemias bearing 11q23 structural abnormalities.

The MLL gene, the closest human homologue to the Drosophila trithorax gene, 
undergoes chromosomal translocation with a large number of different partner 
genes in both acute lymphoid and acute myeloid leukemias. We have identified a 
new partner gene, EEN, fused to MLL in a case of acute myeloid leukemia. The 
gene is located on chromosome 19p13, where two other MLL partner genes, ENL and 
ELL/MEN have also been identified. The deduced protein of 368 aa contains a 
central alpha-helical region and a C-terminal Src homology 3 (SH3) domain most 
similar to the C-terminal SH3 domain found in the Grb2/Sem-5/Drk family of 
genes. Sequence analysis of the fusion MLL/EEN transcript in our patient reveals 
that exon 6 of MLL is fused to the N-terminal end of EEN, a fusion that would 
create a chimeric protein that includes the major functional domain of EEN. EEN 
is expressed in a variety of tissue types and encodes a protein of approximately 
46 kDa. The EEN protein is the human homologue of a member of a recently 
described murine SH3 domain-containing protein family. It is also highly related 
to a putative gene identified in Caenorhabditis elegans, and a number of similar 
sequences are present in the EST databases of several species.

Comment in
    Cancer Cell. 2004 Dec;6(6):531-3.

To better understand the origin of leukemic stem cells, we tested the hypothesis 
that all leukemia oncogenes could transform committed myeloid progenitor cells 
lacking the capacity for self-renewal, as has recently been reported for 
MLL-ENL. Flow-sorted populations of common myeloid progenitors and 
granulocyte-monocyte progenitors were transduced with the oncogenes MOZ-TIF2 and 
BCR-ABL, respectively. MOZ-TIF2-transduced progenitors could be serially 
replated in methylcellulose cultures and continuously propagated in liquid 
culture, and resulted in an acute myeloid leukemia in vivo that could be 
serially transplanted. In contrast, BCR-ABL transduction conferred none of these 
properties to hematopoietic progenitors. These data demonstrate that some, but 
not all, leukemia oncogenes can confer properties of leukemic stem cells to 
hematopoietic progenitors destined to undergo apoptotic cell death.

Chromosomal translocations coding for abnormal proteins are present in several 
human cancers. The junctional region of fusion proteins represents a potential 
target for a T cell-mediated antitumor response. T lymphocytes recognize 
antigens in the form of short peptides that must bind to HLA molecules. 
Different HLA specificities can bind different peptides, thus depicting 
different "peptide binding motifs." It would be useful to know whether a certain 
fusion protein presents, within its fusion region, the binding motif(s) for a 
certain HLA molecule. This information would allow a more focused immunological 
analysis. Here we present data obtained from the screening of the fusion regions 
of 44 different fusion proteins for the presence of binding motifs to 34 class I 
HLA molecules, including all of the most frequently encountered specificities. A 
total of 201 independent peptides was identified (range, 0-11 peptides/fusion 
protein). A marked heterogeneity among the 44 different fusion proteins analyzed 
is evident. For example, the pml/RARalpha fusion protein present in acute 
promyelocytic leukemia presents no binding motif (BCR 3) at all or to a single 
HLA molecule (Cw*0301, BCR 1). Alternatively, the fusion proteins BCR/ABL, 
ALL1/AF-6, EWS/ATF-1, or NPM/ALK exhibit motifs for several common HLA 
specificities. Heterogeneity is also present inside a single translocation (in 
ALL1/ENL, for example, different subtypes match motifs with cumulative 
frequencies in the population from 108 to 0%). In two cases where the relative 
frequency of different fusion protein subtypes was available, a tendency toward 
an inverse relationship between frequency and the percentage of population 
covered by the identified binding motifs was observed. Peptides with motifs for 
HLA A*0201, A3, and Cw*0702 were also tested for actual binding using a 
stabilization assay; 13-40% showed significant HLA binding, using this assay. 
However, fewer fusion protein-derived peptides bound to HLA A*0201 and A3 than 
non-fusion protein-derived peptides. These data provide the first list of 
peptides derived from fusion proteins that may be assessed as potential 
tumor-specific antigens.

The development of a tracheal graft to replace long-segment defects has thwarted 
clinicians and engineers alike for over 100 years. To better understand the 
challenges facing this field today, we have consolidated all published reports 
of engineered tracheal grafts used to repair long-segment circumferential 
defects in humans, from the first in 1898 to the most recent in 2018, totaling 
290 clinical cases. Distinct trends emerge in the types of grafts used over 
time, including repair using autologous fascia, rigid tubes of various inert 
materials, and pretreated cadaveric allografts. Our analysis of maximum clinical 
follow-up, as a proxy for graft performance, revealed that the Leuven protocol 
has a significantly longer clinical follow-up time than all other methods of 
airway reconstruction. This method involves transplanting a cadaveric tracheal 
allograft that is first prevascularized heterotopically in the recipient. We 
further quantified graft-related causes of mortality, revealing failure modes 
that have been resolved, and those that remain a hurdle, such as graft 
mechanics. Finally, we briefly summarize recent preclinical work in tracheal 
graft development. In conclusion, we synthesized top clinical care priorities 
and design criteria to inform and inspire collaboration between engineers and 
clinicians toward the development of a functional tracheal replacement graft. 
Impact statement The field of tracheal engineering has floundered in recent 
years due to multiple article retractions. However, with recent advances in 
biofabrication and tissue analysis techniques, the field remains ripe for 
advancement through collaboration between engineers and clinicians. With a long 
history of clinical application of tracheal replacements, engineered tracheas 
are arguably the regenerative technology with the greatest potential for 
translation. This work describes the many phases of engineered tracheal 
replacements that have been applied in human patients over the past 100 years 
with the goal of carrying forward critical lessons into development of the next 
generation of engineered tracheal graft.

Gene expression profiling in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

Ferrando AA(1), Look AT.

Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.

T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) presents a difficult medical 
problem. T-ALL's clinical features and the biological properties of the leukemia 
cells are not predictive of prognosis, and thus have not been useful for 
risk-specific adjustments in therapeutic intensity. Microarray gene expression 
analyses of T-cell leukemic lymphoblasts have not only improved our 
understanding of the biological heterogeneity of this disease but have revealed 
clinically relevant molecular subtypes. Five different multistep molecular 
pathways have been identified that lead to T-ALL, involving activation of 
different T-ALL oncogenes: (1) HOX11, (2) HOX11L2, (3) TAL1 plus LMO1/2, (4) 
LYL1 plus LMO2, and (5) MLL-ENL. Gene expression studies indicate activation of 
a subset of these genes-HOX11, TAL1, LYL1, LMO1, and LMO2-in a much larger 
fraction of T-ALL cases than those harboring activating chromosomal 
translocations. In many such cases, the abnormal expression of one or more of 
these oncogenes is biallelic, implicating upstream regulatory mechanisms. Among 
these molecular subtypes, overexpression of the HOX11 orphan homeobox gene 
occurs in approximately 5% to 10% of childhood and 30% of adult T-ALL cases. 
Patients with HOX11-positive lymphoblasts have an excellent prognosis when 
treated with modern combination chemotherapy, while cases at high risk of early 
failure are included largely in the TAL1- and LYL1-positive groups. Supervised 
learning approaches applied to microarray data have identified a group of genes 
whose expression is able to distinguish high-risk cases. Further analyses of 
gene expression signatures of T-ALL lymphoblasts are especially needed for 
patients treated on modern combination chemotherapy trials to clearly 
distinguish the 10% to 15% of patients who fail induction or relapse in the 
first year of treatment. These high-risk patients would be ideal candidates for 
more intensive therapies in first remission, such as myeloablative regimens with 
stem cell rescue. Based on the rapid pace of research in T-ALL, made possible in 
large part through microarray technology, deep analysis of molecular pathways 
should lead to new and much more specific targeted therapies.

DNA double-strand break (DSB) is a serious type of DNA damage and is known to 
trigger multiple responses within cells. In these responses, novel relationships 
among DSB, DSB repair, and transcription machineries are created. First, 
transcription is repressed if DSB occurs near or at the transcription site, 
termed DSB-induced transcriptional repression, which contributes to DSB repair 
with the aid of DNA damage-signaling pathways, ATM- or DNA-PKcs-signaling 
pathways. DSB-induced transcriptional repression is also regulated by 
transcriptional factors TLP1, NELF, and ENL, as well as chromatin remodeling and 
organizing factors ZMYND8, CDYL1, PBAF, and cohesin. Second, transcription and 
RNA promote DSB repair for genome integrity. Transcription factors such as 
LEDGF, SETD2, and transcriptionally active histone modification, H3K36, 
facilitate homologous recombination to overcome DSB. At transcriptional active 
sites, DNA:RNA hybrids, termed R-loops, which are formed by DSB, are processed 
by RAD52 and XPG leading to an activation of the homologous recombination 
pathway. Even in a transcriptionally inactive non-genic sites, noncoding RNAs 
that are produced by RNA polymerase II, DICER, and DROSHA, help to recruit DSB 
repair proteins at the DSB sites. Third, transcriptional activation itself, 
however, can induce DSB. Transcriptional activation often generates specific DNA 
structures such as R-loops and topoisomerase-induced DSBs, which cause genotoxic 
stress and may lead to genome instability and consequently to cancer. Thus, 
transcription and DSB repair machineries interact and cooperate to prevent 
genome instability and cancer.

Leukotrienes (LT) are lipid mediators of the inflammatory response that play key 
roles in diseases such as asthma and atherosclerosis. The precursor leukotriene 
A4 (LTA4) is synthesized from arachidonic acid (AA) by 5‑lipoxygenase (5-LOX), a 
membrane-associated enzyme, with the help of 5‑lipoxygenase-activating protein 
(FLAP), a nuclear transmembrane protein. In lipoxygenases the main chain 
carboxylate of the C-terminus is a ligand for the non-heme iron and thus part of 
the catalytic center. We investigated the role of a lysine-rich sequence 
(KKK653-655) 20 amino acids upstream of the C-terminus unique to 5-LOX that 
might displace the main-chain carboxylate in the iron coordination sphere. A 
5-LOX mutant in which KKK653-655 is replaced by ENL was transfected into HEK293 
cells in the absence and presence of FLAP. This mutant gave ~20-fold higher 
5-LOX product levels in stimulated HEK cells relative to the wild-type 5-LOX. 
Co-expression of the enzymes with FLAP led to an equalization of 5-LOX products 
detected, with wild-type 5-LOX product levels increased and those from the 
mutant enzyme decreased. These data suggest that the KKK motif limits 5-LOX 
activity and that this attenuated activity must be compensated by the presence 
of FLAP as a partner protein for effective LT biosynthesis.

The EVI1 gene (3q26) codes for a transcription factor with important roles in 
normal hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis. High expression of EVI1 is a negative 
prognostic indicator of survival in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) irrespective of 
the presence of 3q26 rearrangements. However, the only known mechanisms that 
lead to EVI1 overexpression are 3q aberrations, and the MLL-ENL oncoprotein, 
which activates the transcription of EVI1 in hematopoietic stem cells. Our aim 
was to characterize the functional promoter region of EVI1, and to identify 
transcription factors involved in the regulation of this gene. Generation of 
seven truncated constructs and luciferase reporter assays allowed us to 
determine a 318-bp region as the minimal promoter region of EVI1. Site-directed 
mutagenesis and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays identified RUNX1 and 
ELK1 as putative transcription factors of EVI1. Furthermore, knockdown of RUNX1 
and ELK1 led to EVI1 downregulation, and their overexpression to upregulation of 
EVI1. Interestingly, in a series of patient samples with AML at diagnosis, we 
found a significant positive correlation between EVI1 and RUNX1 at protein 
level. Moreover, we identified one of the roles of RUNX1 in the activation of 
EVI1 during megakaryocytic differentiation. EVI1 knockdown significantly 
inhibited the expression of megakaryocytic markers after treating K562 cells 
with TPA, as happens when knocking down RUNX1. In conclusion, we define the 
minimal promoter region of EVI1 and demonstrate that RUNX1 and ELK1, two 
proteins with essential functions in hematopoiesis, regulate EVI1 in AML. 
Furthermore, our results show that one of the mechanisms by which RUNX1 
regulates the transcription of EVI1 is by acetylation of the histone H3 on its 
promoter region. This study opens new directions to further understand the 
mechanisms of EVI1 overexpressing leukemias.

The AF10 leucine zipper is required for leukemic transformation of myeloid 
progenitors by MLL-AF10.

The t(10;11)(p12;q23) chromosomal translocation in human acute myeloid leukemia 
results in the fusion of the MLL and AF10 genes. The latter codes for a novel 
leucine zipper protein, one of many MLL fusion partners of unknown function. In 
this report, we demonstrate that retroviral-mediated transduction of an MLL-AF10 
complementary DNA into primary murine myeloid progenitors enhanced their 
clonogenic potential in serial replating assays and led to their efficient 
immortalization at a primitive stage of myeloid differentiation. Furthermore, 
MLL-AF10-transduced cells rapidly induced acute myeloid leukemia in syngeneic or 
severe combined immunodeficiency recipient mice. Structure/function analysis 
showed that a highly conserved 82-amino acid portion of AF10, comprising 2 
adjacent alpha-helical domains, was sufficient for immortalizing activity when 
fused to MLL. Neither helical domain alone mediated immortalization, and 
deletion of the 29-amino acid leucine zipper within this region completely 
abrogated transforming activity. Similarly, the minimal oncogenic domain of AF10 
exhibited transcriptional activation properties when fused to the MLL or GAL4 
DNA-binding domains, while neither helical domain alone did. However, 
transcriptional activation per se was not sufficient because a second activation 
domain of AF10 was neither required nor competent for transformation. The 
requirement for alpha-helical transcriptional effector domains is similar to the 
oncogenic contributions of unrelated MLL partners ENL and ELL, suggesting a 
general mechanism of myeloid leukemogenesis by a subset of MLL fusion proteins, 
possibly through specific recruitment of the transcriptional machinery.

BACKGROUND: Walking among Latinos in US Micropolitan towns may vary by language 
spoken.
METHODS: In 2011-2012, we collected telephone survey and built environment (BE) 
data from adults in six towns located within micropolitan counties from two 
states with sizable Latino populations. We performed mixed-effects logistic 
regression modeling to examine relationships between ethnicity-language group 
[Spanish-speaking Latinos (SSLs); English-speaking Latinos (ESLs); and 
English-speaking non-Latinos (ENLs)] and utilitarian walking and recreational 
walking, accounting for socio-demographic, lifestyle and BE characteristics.
RESULTS: Low-income SSLs reported higher amounts of utilitarian walking than 
ENLs (p = 0.007), but utilitarian walking in this group decreased as income 
increased. SSLs reported lower amounts of recreational walking than ENLs 
(p = 0.004). ESL-ENL differences were not significant. We identified no 
statistically significant interactions between ethnicity-language group and BE 
characteristics.
DISCUSSION: Approaches to increase walking in micropolitan towns with sizable 
SSL populations may need to account for this group's differences in walking 
behaviors.

Zinc finger protein 521 (ZNF521) is a multiple zinc finger transcription factor 
and a strong candidate as regulator of hematopoietic stem cell homeostasis. 
Recently, independent gene expression profile studies have evidenced a positive 
correlation between ZNF521 mRNA overexpression and MLL-rearranged acute myeloid 
leukemia (AML), leaving open the question on the role of ZNF521 in this subtype 
of leukemia. In this study, we sought to analyze the effect of ZNF521 depletion 
on MLL-rearranged AML cell lines and MLL-AF9 xenograft primary cells. Knockdown 
of ZNF521 with short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) led to decreased leukemia 
proliferation, reduced colony formation and caused cell cycle arrest in 
MLL-rearranged AML cell lines. Importantly, we showed that loss of ZNF521 
substantially caused differentiation of both MLL-rearranged cell lines and 
primary cells. Moreover, gene profile analysis in ZNF521-silenced THP-1 cells 
revealed a loss of MLL-AF9-directed leukemic signature and an increase of the 
differentiation program. Finally, we determined that both MLL-AF9 and MLL-ENL 
fusion proteins directly interacted with ZNF521 promoter activating its 
transcription. In conclusion, our findings identify ZNF521 as a critical 
effector of MLL fusion proteins in blocking myeloid differentiation and 
highlight ZNF521 as a potential therapeutic target for this subtype of leukemia.

Estrogen-regulated conditional oncoproteins: tools to address open questions in 
normal myeloid cell function, normal myeloid differentiation, and the genetic 
basis of differentiation arrest in myeloid leukemia.

Neutrophils, monocytes and dendritic cells are effectors of innate immunity and 
essential coactivators in the acquired immune response. Understanding the 
biochemical basis of their mature cell functions, their differentiation from 
hematopoietic progenitors, and the mechanisms by which myeloid leukemia 
oncogenes block their differentiation programs, continue to be areas of active 
research. Four major problems limit progress in these fields. First, the 
biochemical analysis of mature cells is limited by the time and cost of 
purifying neutrophils, monocytes, or dendritic cells from wild-type and 
genetically modified mouse strains. Second, while immortal myeloid cell lines 
are used to understand the transcriptional basis of normal terminal 
differentiation following their treatment with differentiationpromoting agents 
(e.g. G-CSF, IL-6, RA, TPA), these cells contain stable defects responsible for 
their immortalization, and the degree to which they model normal differentiation 
is often incomplete. Third, these same inducible cell lines are used as model 
systems to determine how myeloid oncoproteins prevent differentiation; however, 
oncoproteins that block differentiation of marrow progenitors cultured in GM-CSF 
or IL-3 but permit their differentiation in response to G-CSF or RA, do not 
score effectively in these assays (e.g. Hoxa9, Mll-Enl). Fourth, there is no 
reproducible method to derive myeloid progenitor lines that execute predictable 
terminal differentiation to neutrophils, monocytes, or dendritic cells. 
Developing this type of system is needed to evaluate how myeloid gene 
inactivation by knockout technologies alters lineage-specific differentiation 
and mature cell function. Conditional myeloid oncoproteins provide a tool to 
solve these research problems by providing a predictable and inexpensive means 
of expanding, in culture, GM-CSF- or IL-3-dependent myeloid progenitors from any 
genotype, and by permitting their synchronous differentiation to neutrophils, 
monocytes, or dendritic cells under defined culture conditions following 
inactivation of the conditional oncoprotein. This system of conditionally 
immortalizing normal bone marrow precursors provides the large numbers of normal 
cells required for analysis of cell biology and protein biochemistry, and 
further provides a model system in which to study the genetic mechanisms 
controlling terminal differentiation and how specific oncoproteins expressed in 
the cell lines prevent this differentiation program. The ability to derive 
conditionally-immortalized progenitor lines from knock-out mice provides cell 
lines for the reconstitution of knockout gene function and subsequent dissection 
of knockout protein function by mutational analysis. Finally, conditional 
myeloid cell lines can be established from both ES cells and from d10 fetal 
liver cells, allowing for the analysis of embryonic lethal mutants on both the 
maturation and terminal differentiation of mature myeloid cells. In this 
review,we summarize the importance and limitations of current approaches in 
myeloid cell research, and how estrogen-regulated conditional oncoproteins help 
to solve these problems.

We have cloned a fusion partner of the MLL gene at 11q23 and identified it as 
the gene encoding the human formin-binding protein 17, FBP17. It maps to 
chromosome 9q34 centromeric to ABL. The gene fusion results from a complex 
chromosome rearrangement that was resolved by fluorescence in situ hybridization 
with various probes on chromosomes 9 and 11 as an 
ins(11;9)(q23;q34)inv(11)(q13q23). The rearrangement resulted in a 
5'-MLL/FBP17-3' fusion mRNA. We retrovirally transduced murine-myeloid 
progenitor cells with MLL/FBP17 to test its transforming ability. In contrast to 
MLL/ENL, MLL/ELL and other MLL-fusion genes, MLL/FBP17 did not give a positive 
readout in a serial replating assay. Therefore, we assume that additional 
cooperating genetic abnormalities might be needed to establish a full malignant 
phenotype. FBP17 consists of a C-terminal Src homology 3 domain and an 
N-terminal region that is homologous to the cell division cycle protein, cdc15, 
a regulator of the actin cytoskeleton in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Both domains 
are separated by a consensus Rho-binding motif that has been identified in 
different Rho-interaction partners such as Rhotekin and Rhophilin. We evaluated 
whether FBP17 and members of the Rho family interact in vivo with a yeast 
two-hybrid assay. None of the various Rho proteins tested, however, interacted 
with FBP17. We screened a human kidney library and identified a sorting nexin, 
SNX2, as a protein interaction partner of FBP17. These data provide a link 
between the epidermal growth factor receptor pathway and an MLL fusion protein.

Establishment and characterization of human B cell precursor-leukemia cell 
lines.

A large number of continuous human leukemia cell lines have been established 
over the last three decades. Clearly, leukemia cell lines have become important 
research tools. Here, we have summarized the immunological, molecular and 
standard cytogenetic features of a panel of well characterized B cell precursor 
(BCP)-leukemia cell lines which were derived from patients with acute 
lymphoblastic/undifferentiated leukemia (ALL/AUL) or chronic myeloid leukemia 
(CML) in blast crisis. Following the recently proposed immunological EGIL 
classification, we assigned our panel of 27 BCP-cell lines to one of the 
following categories: B-I pro-B cell line; B-II common-B cell line; and B-III 
pre-B cell line. All cell lines express general B-lineage associated surface 
markers (HLA-DR, CD22, CD79a) being negative for surface immunoglobulin (Ig); 
the differences between the subgroups reside in expression of CD10 and 
cytoplasmic Ig. Several BCP-cell lines show the myelomonocytic cell-associated 
markers CD13 and/or CD33. These immunologically 'biphenotypic' BCP-cell lines 
are generally TdT+ CD10+ CD13+ CD19+ CD22+ CD34+ and carry the Philadelphia (Ph) 
translocation. The BCP-cell lines display surface receptors for interferon-gamma 
(CD119), interleukin-7 (CD127) and FLT-3 ligand (CD135). All BCP-cell lines 
examined have complex numerical and structural chromosomal alterations including 
translocations commonly seen in BCP-ALL such as t(4;11), t(9;22), t(11;19), 
t(12;21), and t(17;19) involving the fusion genes MLL-AF4, BCR-ABL, ENL-MLL, 
TEL/ETV6-AML1 and E2A-HLF, respectively. Besides the expected rearrangement of 
the Ig heavy chain receptor gene, several cell lines also have rearrangements of 
the T cell receptor genes beta, gamma or delta. While some BCP-cell lines 
express (aberrantly) myeloperoxidase at the mRNA level, most lines are negative 
in the immunological or cytochemical staining. Several large series documented 
the difficulty in establishing such BCP cell lines with success rates in the 
range of 10-20% (on average 15%). Still, since the establishment of the first 
bonafide BCP-cell line in 1974 (cell line REH), some 150 cell lines have been 
established of which, however, only a small percentage have been sufficiently 
well characterized and described. A higher success rate for immortalizing any 
given leukemia cell might depend on a closer emulation of the physiological in 
vivo microenvironment. The possibility to grow in vitro leukemia cells at will 
would represent ideal experimental systems permitting basic research and 
patient-specific investigations. In summary, the use of well-characterized 
BCP-cell lines provide unprecedented opportunities for studying a multitude of 
biological aspects related to normal and neoplastic B-lymphocytes.

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia in infants (< 1 year-of-age) is characterized by a 
high incidence of MLL rearrangements. Recently, direct targets of the MLL fusion 
protein have been identified. However, functional validation of the identified 
targets remained unacknowledged. In this study, we identify CDK6 as a direct 
target of the MLL fusion protein and an important player in the proliferation 
advantage of MLL-rearranged leukemia. CDK6 mRNA was significantly higher 
expressed in MLL-rearranged infant ALL patients compared with MLL wild-type ALL 
patients (P < 0.001). Decrease of MLL-AF4 and MLL-ENL fusion mRNA expression by 
siRNAs resulted in downregulation of CDK6, affirming a direct relationship 
between the presence of the MLL fusion and CDK6 expression. Knockdown of CDK6 
itself significantly inhibited proliferation in the MLL-AF4-positive cell line 
SEM, whereas knockdown of the highly homologous gene CDK4 had virtually no 
effect on the cell cycle. Furthermore, we show in vitro sensitivity of 
MLL-rearranged leukemia cell lines to the CDK4/6-inhibitor PD0332991, inducing a 
remarkable G 1 arrest, and downregulation of its downstream targets pRB1 and 
EZH2. We therefore conclude that CDK6 is indeed a direct target of MLL fusion 
proteins, playing an important role in the proliferation advantage of 
MLL-rearranged ALL cells.

Interactions between the nuclear factor (NF)-κB inhibitor parthenolide and the 
pan-histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs) vorinostat and LBH589 were 
investigated in human acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) cells, including primary AML 
blasts. Co-administration of parthenolide blocked HDACI-mediated 
phosphorylation/activation of IKK and RelA/p65 in association with increased 
JNK1 activation in various AML cell types. These events were accompanied by an 
increase in apoptosis in multiple AML cell lines (e.g. U937, HL-60, NB4, 
MV-4-11, and MOLM-13). Significantly, parthenolide also increased HDACI-mediated 
cell death in haematopoietic cells transduced with the MLL-MLLT1 fusion gene, 
which exhibit certain leukaemia-initiating cell characteristics, as well as 
primary AML blasts. Exposure to parthenolide/HDACI regimens clearly inhibited 
the growth of AML-colony-forming units but was relatively sparing toward normal 
haematopoietic progenitors. Notably, blockade of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) 
signalling by either pharmacological inhibitors or genetic means (e.g. 
dominant-negative JNK1 or JNK1 shRNA) diminished parthenolide/HDACI-mediated 
lethality. Moreover, dominant-negative MKK7, but not dominant-negative 
MKK4/SEK1, blocked JNK1 activation and apoptosis induced by parthenolide/HDACI 
regimens. Together, these findings indicate that parthenolide potentiates HDACI 
lethality in human AML cells through a process involving NF-κB inhibition and 
subsequent MKK7-dependent activation of the SAPK/JNK pathway. They also raise 
the possibility that this strategy may target leukaemic progenitor cells.

BACKGROUND: JL1 is a newly identified CD43 epitope that specifically recognizes 
leukemic cells. We analyzed the incidence of JL1 expression and compared the 
clinical, immunophenotypic, and genetic characteristics of de novo pediatric 
acute leukemia patients with respect to JL1 expression status to determine the 
therapeutic potential of an anti-JL1 antibody.
METHODS: Seventy-eight patients with pediatric acute leukemia (52 with ALL, 26 
with AML) diagnosed between December 2014 and January 2016 were enrolled 
prospectively. Flow cytometry for JL1 expression was performed at diagnosis. 
Clinical, immunophenotypic, and genetic characteristics were compared with 
respect to JL1 expression status by the Student t-test/Mann-Whitney U test and 
chi-square test/Fisher's exact test.
RESULTS: The incidence of JL1 expression was 76.9% and 84.6% in ALL and AML 
patients, respectively. ALL patients with JL1 expression showed higher CD10 and 
cytoplasmic IgM expressions than those without JL1 expression (P=0.022 and 
0.003, respectively) and were associated with TCF3-PBX1 and KMT2A-MLLT1 
translocations. AML patients with JL1 expression showed higher CD13 and lower 
CD65 and CD15 expressions than those without JL1 expression (P=0.013, 0.007, and 
0.024, respectively) and were associated with RUNX1-RUNX1T1, PML-RARA, and 
CBFB-MYH11 translocations. The JL1 expression incidence did not differ between 
ALL and AML, and the JL1 expression status did not affect prognosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the potential therapeutic role of anti-JL1 
monoclonal antibodies; JL1 expression was associated with specific 
immunophenotypes and genetic abnormalities. Future studies should examine the 
prognostic impact of JL1 expression in pediatric acute leukemias.

Inhibition of the apoptosis pathway controlled by opposing members of the Bcl-2 
protein family plays a central role in cancer development and resistance to 
therapy. To investigate how pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 homology domain 3 (BH3)-only 
proteins impact on acute myeloid leukemia (AML), we generated mixed lineage 
leukemia (MLL)-AF9 and MLL-ENL AMLs from BH3-only gene knockout mice. Disease 
development was not accelerated by loss of Bim, Puma, Noxa, Bmf, or combinations 
thereof; hence these BH3-only proteins are apparently ineffectual as tumor 
suppressors in this model. We tested the sensitivity of MLL-AF9 AMLs of each 
genotype in vitro to standard chemotherapeutic drugs and to the proteasome 
inhibitor bortezomib, with or without the BH3 mimetic ABT-737. Loss of Puma 
and/or Noxa increased resistance to cytarabine, daunorubicin and etoposide, 
while loss of Bim protected against cytarabine and loss of Bmf had no impact. 
ABT-737 increased sensitivity to the genotoxic drugs but was not dependent on 
any BH3-only protein tested. The AML lines were very sensitive to bortezomib and 
loss of Noxa conveyed significant resistance. In vivo, several MLL-AF9 AMLs 
responded well to daunorubicin and this response was highly dependent on Puma 
and Noxa but not Bim. Combination therapy with ABT-737 provided little added 
benefit at the daunorubicin dose trialed. Bortezomib also extended survival of 
AML-bearing mice, albeit less than daunorubicin. In summary, our genetic studies 
reveal the importance of Puma and Noxa for the action of genotoxics currently 
used to treat MLL-driven AML and suggest that, while addition of ABT-737-like 
BH3 mimetics might enhance their efficacy, new Noxa-like BH3 mimetics targeting 
Mcl-1 might have greater potential.

ELL-associated factor 2 (EAF2), a functional homolog of EAF1 with alternative 
ELL binding properties.

The (11;19)(q23;p13.1) translocation in acute leukemia results in the formation 
of an MLL-ELL fusion protein. ELL is an RNA polymerase II elongation factor that 
interacts with the recently identified EAF1 protein. To characterize the normal 
functions of ELL and its aberrant activities when fused to MLL, we isolated a 
second protein that interacts with ELL named EAF2 for ELL Associated Factor 2. 
EAF2 is highly homologous to EAF1, with 58% identity and 74% amino acid 
conservation. Using specific antibodies generated to EAF2, we 
coimmunoprecipitated ELL and EAF2 from multiple cell lines. Confocal microscopy 
revealed that endogenous EAF2 and ELL colocalized in a nuclear speckled pattern. 
Database comparisons with EAF2 identified a region with a high content of 
serine, aspartic acid, and glutamic acid residues that is conserved with EAF1 
and exhibited amino acid similarity with several translocation partner proteins 
of MLL, including AF4 and ENL. We found that EAF2 and EAF1 both contain 
transcriptional activation domains within this region. Using retroviral bone 
marrow transduction, we observed that a heterologous fusion of EAF2 to MLL 
immortalized hematopoietic progenitor cells. In contrast to EAF1, EAF2 does not 
bind to the carboxy-terminus of ELL. We identified a protein-protein interaction 
domain within the amino-terminus of ELL that binds to both EAF1 and EAF2. This 
amino-terminal interaction domain is disrupted in the formation of the MLL-ELL 
fusion protein. Thus, MLL-ELL retains an interaction domain for EAF1 but not for 
EAF2. Taken together, these data suggest that MLL-ELL may disrupt the normal 
protein-protein interactions of ELL.

HIV-1 transactivator Tat has greatly contributed to our understanding of 
transcription elongation by RNAPII. We purified HIV-1 Tat-associated factors 
from HeLa nuclear extract and show that Tat forms two distinct and stable 
complexes. Tatcom1 consists of the core active P-TEFb, MLL-fusion partners 
involved in leukemia (AF9, AFF4, AFF1, ENL, and ELL), and PAF1 complex. 
Importantly, Tatcom1 formation relies on P-TEFb while optimal CDK9 CTD-kinase 
activity is AF9 dependent. MLL-fusion partners and PAF1 are required for Tat 
transactivation. Tatcom2 is composed of CDK9, CycT1, and 7SK snRNP lacking 
HEXIM. Tat remodels 7SK snRNP by interacting directly with 7SK RNA, leading to 
the formation of a stress-resistant 7SK snRNP particle. Besides the 
identification of factors required for Tat transactivation and important for 
P-TEFb function, our data show a coordinated control of RNAPII elongation by 
different classes of transcription elongation factors associated in a single 
complex and acting at the same promoter.

The mechanisms by which mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) fusion products resulting 
from in utero translocations in 11q23 contribute to leukemogenesis and infant 
acute leukemia remain elusive. It is still controversial whether the MLL fusion 
protein is sufficient to induce acute leukemia without additional genetic 
alterations, although carcinogenesis in general is known to result from more 
than 1 genetic disorder accumulating during a lifetime. Here we demonstrate that 
the fusion partner-mediated homo-oligomerization of MLL-SEPT6 is essential to 
immortalize hematopoietic progenitors in vitro. MLL-SEPT6 induced 
myeloproliferative disease with long latency in mice, but not acute leukemia, 
implying that secondary genotoxic events are required to develop leukemia. We 
developed in vitro and in vivo model systems of leukemogenesis by MLL fusion 
proteins, where activated FMS-like receptor tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) together 
with MLL-SEPT6 not only transformed hematopoietic progenitors in vitro but also 
induced acute biphenotypic or myeloid leukemia with short latency in vivo. In 
these systems, MLL-ENL, another type of the fusion product that seems to act as 
a monomer, also induced the transformation in vitro and leukemogenesis in vivo 
in concert with activated FLT3. These findings show direct evidence for a 
multistep leukemogenesis mediated by MLL fusion proteins and may be applicable 
to development of direct MLL fusion-targeted therapy.

Leukemic HRX fusion proteins inhibit GADD34-induced apoptosis and associate with 
the GADD34 and hSNF5/INI1 proteins.

One of the most common chromosomal abnormalities in acute leukemia is a 
reciprocal translocation involving the HRX gene (also called MLL, ALL-1, or 
HTRX) at chromosomal locus 11q23, resulting in the formation of HRX fusion 
proteins. Using the yeast two-hybrid system and human cell culture 
coimmunoprecipitation experiments, we show here that HRX proteins interact 
directly with the GADD34 protein. We have found that transfected cells 
overexpressing GADD34 display a significant increase in apoptosis after 
treatment with ionizing radiation, indicating that GADD34 expression not only 
correlates with apoptosis but also can enhance apoptosis. The amino-terminal 
third of the GADD34 protein was necessary for this observed increase in 
apoptosis. Furthermore, coexpression of three different HRX fusion proteins 
(HRX-ENL, HRX-AF9, and HRX-ELL) had an anti-apoptotic effect, abrogating 
GADD34-induced apoptosis. In contrast, expression of wild-type HRX gave rise to 
an increase in apoptosis. The difference observed here between wild-type HRX and 
the leukemic HRX fusion proteins suggests that inhibition of GADD34-mediated 
apoptosis may be important to leukemogenesis. We also show here that GADD34 
binds the human SNF5/INI1 protein, a member of the SNF/SWI complex that can 
remodel chromatin and activate transcription. These studies demonstrate, for the 
first time, a gain of function for leukemic HRX fusion proteins compared to 
wild-type protein. We propose that the role of HRX fusion proteins as negative 
regulators of post-DNA-damage-induced apoptosis is important to leukemia 
progression.

In vivo andin vitro studies of adaptor-clathrin interaction.

USA.

A major endocytic pathway initiates with the formation of clathrin-coated 
vesicles (CCVs) that transport cargo from the cell surface to endosomes. CCVs 
are distinguished by a polyhedral lattice of clathrin that coats the vesicle 
membrane and serves as a mechanical scaffold. Clathrin coats are assembled 
during vesicle formation from individual clathrin triskelia , the soluble form 
of clathrin composed of three heavy and three light chain subunits. Because the 
triskelion does not have the ability to bind to the membrane directly, 
clathrin-binding adaptors are critical to link the forming clathrin lattice to 
the membrane through association with lipids and/or membrane proteins. Adaptors 
also package transmembrane protein cargo, such as receptors, and can interact 
with each other and with other components of the CCV formation machinery. Over 
twenty clathrin adaptors have been described, several are involved in clathrin 
mediated endocytosis and others localize to the trans Golgi network or 
endosomes. With the exception of HIP1R (yeast Sla2p), all known clathrin 
adaptors bind to the N-terminal -propeller domain of the clathrin heavy chain. 
Clathrin adaptors are modular proteins consisting of folded domains connected by 
unstructured flexible linkers. Within these linker regions, short binding motifs 
mediate interactions with the clathrin N-terminal domain or other components of 
the vesicle formation machinery. Two distinct clathrin-binding motifs have been 
defined: the clathrin-box and the W-box. The consensus clathrin-box sequence was 
originally defined as L[L/I][D/E/N][L/F][D/E] but variants have been 
subsequently discovered. The W-box conforms to the sequence PWxxW (where x is 
any residue). Sla1p (Synthetic Lethal with Actin binding protein-1) was 
originally identified as an actin associated protein and is necessary for normal 
actin cytoskeleton structure and dynamics at endocytic sites in yeast cells. 
Sla1p also binds the NPFxD endocytic sorting signal and is critical for 
endocytosis of cargo bearing the NPFxD signal. More recently, Sla1p was 
demonstrated to bind clathrin through a motif similar to the clathrin box, 
LLDLQ, termed a variant clathrin-box (vCB), and to function as an endocytic 
clathrin adaptor. In addition, Sla1p has become a widely used marker for the 
endocytic coat in live cell fluorescence microscopy studies. Here we use Sla1p 
as a model to describe approaches for adaptor-clathrin interaction studies. We 
focus on live cell fluorescence microscopy, GST-pull down, and 
co-immunoprecipitation methods.

The genetic heterogeneity of cancer influences the trajectory of tumor 
progression and may underlie clinical variation in therapy response. To model 
such heterogeneity, we produced genetically and pathologically accurate mouse 
models of common forms of human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and developed 
methods to mimic standard induction chemotherapy and efficiently monitor therapy 
response. We see that murine AMLs harboring two common human AML genotypes show 
remarkably diverse responses to conventional therapy that mirror clinical 
experience. Specifically, murine leukemias expressing the AML1/ETO fusion 
oncoprotein, associated with a favorable prognosis in patients, show a dramatic 
response to induction chemotherapy owing to robust activation of the p53 tumor 
suppressor network. Conversely, murine leukemias expressing MLL fusion proteins, 
associated with a dismal prognosis in patients, are drug-resistant due to an 
attenuated p53 response. Our studies highlight the importance of genetic 
information in guiding the treatment of human AML, functionally establish the 
p53 network as a central determinant of chemotherapy response in AML, and 
demonstrate that genetically engineered mouse models of human cancer can 
accurately predict therapy response in patients.

Leukemogenesis via aberrant self-renewal by the MLL/AEP-mediated transcriptional 
activation system.

Homeostasis of the hematopoietic system is achieved in a hierarchy, with 
hematopoietic stem cells at the pinnacle. Because only hematopoietic stem cells 
(HSCs) can self-renew, the size of the hematopoietic system is strictly 
controlled. In hematopoietic reconstitution experiments, 1 HSC can reconstitute 
the entire hematopoietic system, whereas 50 multipotent progenitors cannot. This 
indicates that only HSCs self-renew, whereas non-HSC hematopoietic progenitors 
are programmed to differentiate or senesce. Oncogenic mutations of the mixed 
lineage leukemia gene (MLL) overcome this "programmed differentiation" by 
conferring the self-renewing ability to non-HSC hematopoietic progenitors. In 
leukemia, mutated MLL proteins constitutively activate a broad range of 
previously transcribed CpG-rich promoters by an MLL-mediated transcriptional 
activation system. This system promotes self-renewal by replicating an 
expression profile similar to that of the mother cell in its daughter cells. In 
this transcriptional activation system, MLL binds to unmethylated CpG-rich 
promoters and recruits RNA polymerase II. MLL recruits p300/CBP through its 
transcriptional activation domain, which acetylates histone H3 at lysines 9, 18, 
and 27. The AF4 family/ENL family/P-TEFb complex (AEP) binds to acetylated 
H3K9/18/27 to activate transcription. Gene rearrangements of MLL with AEP- or 
CBP/p300-complex components generate constitutively active transcriptional 
machinery of this transcriptional activation system, which causes aberrant 
self-renewal of leukemia stem cells. Inhibitors of the components of this system 
effectively decrease their leukemogenic potential.

BACKGROUND: Standard dapsone and clofazimine-containing multidrug therapy (MDT) 
for leprosy is limited by drug tolerability, which poses treatment adherence 
barriers. Although ofloxacin-based regimens are promising alternatives, current 
efficacy and safety data are limited, particularly outside of endemic areas. We 
evaluated treatment outcomes in patients with leprosy receiving 
ofloxacin-containing MDT (OMDT) at our center.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review of patients treated for 
leprosy at our center over an 8-year period (2011-2019). Primary outcomes 
evaluated were clinical cure rate, occurrence of leprosy reactions, 
antibiotic-related adverse events, and treatment adherence. Analyses were 
descriptive; however, data were stratified by age, sex, spectrum of disease, 
region of origin, and treatment regimen, and odds ratios were reported to assess 
associations with adverse outcomes.
RESULTS: Over the enrolment period, 26 patients were treated with OMDT (n = 19 
multibacillary, n = 7 paucibacillary), and none were treated with 
clofazimine-based standard MDT. At the time of analysis, 23 patients (88%) had 
completed their course of treatment, and all were clinically cured, while 3 
(12%) were still on treatment. Eighteen patients (69%) experienced either ENL (n 
= 7, 27%), type 1 reactions (n = 7, 27%), or both (n = 4, 15%). No patients 
stopped ofloxacin due to adverse drug effects, and there were no cases of 
allergic hypersensitivity, tendinopathy or rupture, or C. difficile colitis.
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate a high cure rate and tolerability of OMDT in this 
small case series over an 8-year period, suggesting its viability as an 
alternative to standard clofazimine-containing MDT.

Three Na+ sites are defined in the Na+-bound crystal structure of Na+, 
K+-ATPase. Sites I and II overlap with two K+ sites in the K+-bound structure, 
whereas site III is unique and Na+ specific. A glutamine in transmembrane helix 
M8 (Q925) appears from the crystal structures to coordinate Na+ at site III, but 
does not contribute to K+ coordination at sites I and II. Here we address the 
functional role of Q925 in the various conformational states of Na+, K+-ATPase 
by examining the mutants Q925A/G/E/N/L/I/Y. We characterized these mutants both 
enzymatically and electrophysiologically, thereby revealing their Na+ and K+ 
binding properties. Remarkably, Q925 substitutions had minor effects on Na+ 
binding from the intracellular side of the membrane - in fact, mutations Q925A 
and Q925G increased the apparent Na+ affinity - but caused dramatic reductions 
of the binding of K+ as well as Na+ from the extracellular side of the membrane. 
These results provide insight into the changes taking place in the Na+-binding 
sites, when they are transformed from intracellular- to extracellular-facing 
orientation in relation to the ion translocation process, and demonstrate the 
interaction between sites III and I and a possible gating function of Q925 in 
the release of Na+ at the extracellular side.

Cloning of ELL, a gene that fuses to MLL in a t(11;19)(q23;p13.1) in acute 
myeloid leukemia.

To characterize the functions of MLL fusion transcripts, we cloned the gene that 
fuses to MLL in the translocation t(11;19)(q23;p13.1). This translocation is 
distinct from another type of 11;19 translocation with a 19p13.3 breakpoint that 
results in the fusion of MLL to the ENL gene. By PCR screening of a cDNA library 
prepared from a patient's leukemia cells with this translocation, we obtained a 
fusion transcript containing exon 7 of MLL and sequence of an unknown gene. The 
sequence of this gene was amplified and used as a probe to screen a fetal brain 
cDNA library. On Northern blot analysis, this cDNA detected a 4.4-kb transcript 
that was abundant in peripheral blood leukocytes, skeletal muscle, placenta, and 
testis and expressed at lower levels in spleen, thymus, heart, brain, lung, 
kidney, liver, and ovary. In addition, a 2.8-kb transcript was present in 
peripheral blood, testis, and placenta. On "zoo blots," this gene was shown to 
be evolutionarily conserved in 10 mammalian species as well as in chicken, frog, 
and fish. We have named this gene ELL (for eleven-nineteen lysine-rich leukemia 
gene). A highly basic, lysine-rich motif of the predicted ELL protein is 
homologous to similar regions of several proteins, including the DNA-binding 
domain of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. The characterization of the normal 
functions of ELL as well as its altered function when fused to MLL will be 
critical to further our understanding of the mechanisms of leukemogenesis.

A significant barrier to implementation of cell-based therapies is providing 
adequate vascularization to provide oxygen and nutrients. Here we describe an 
approach for cell transplantation termed the Therapeutic Vascular Conduit (TVC), 
which uses an acellular vessel as a scaffold for a hydrogel sheath containing 
cells designed to secrete a therapeutic protein. The TVC can be directly 
anastomosed as a vascular graft. Modeling supports the concept that the TVC 
allows oxygenated blood to flow in close proximity to the transplanted cells to 
prevent hypoxia. As a proof-of-principle study, we used erythropoietin (EPO) as 
a model therapeutic protein. If implanted as an arteriovenous vascular graft, 
such a construct could serve a dual role as an EPO delivery platform and 
hemodialysis access for patients with end-stage renal disease. When implanted 
into nude rats, TVCs containing EPO-secreting fibroblasts were able to increase 
serum EPO and hemoglobin levels for up to 4 weeks. However, constitutive EPO 
expression resulted in macrophage infiltration and luminal obstruction of the 
TVC, thus limiting longer-term efficacy. Follow-up in vitro studies support the 
hypothesis that EPO also functions to recruit macrophages. The TVC is a 
promising approach to cell-based therapeutic delivery that has the potential to 
overcome the oxygenation barrier to large-scale cellular implantation and could 
thus be used for a myriad of clinical disorders. However, a complete 
understanding of the biological effects of the selected therapeutic is 
absolutely essential.

We report the results of a phase 1 dose-escalation study of belinostat and 
bortezomib in adult patients with acute leukemia or MDS or CML with blast 
crisis. Thirty-eight patients received IV belinostat days 1-5 and 8-12 with IV 
bortezomib days 1, 4, 8, and 11 every 21 days. QTc prolongation was the only 
identified DLT. The RP2Ds were 1.3 mg/m2 bortezomib and 1000 mg/m2 belinostat. 
One patient with highly refractory MLL-ENL rearranged biphenotypic AML with 
multiple karyotypic aberrations had a complete pathologic and karyotypic 
response. One patient with post-MPN AML remained on study with stable disease 
(SD) for 32 cycles. Whole-exome sequencing revealed no aberrations in the first 
patient and a hyper-mutator genotype in the second. Eighteen patients had a best 
response of SD. We conclude that this treatment strategy is feasible but has 
limited activity in this population. Nevertheless, the factors that predict 
exceptional responses to this strategy warrant further investigation.

Cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) is critical for RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) 
transcription initiation, elongation, and termination in several key biological 
processes including development, differentiation, and cell fate responses. A 
broad range of diseases are characterized by CDK9 malfunction, illustrating its 
importance in maintaining transcriptional homeostasis in basal- and 
signal-regulated conditions. Here we provide a historical recount of CDK9 
discovery and the current models suggesting CDK9 is a central hub necessary for 
proper execution of different steps in the transcription cycle. Finally, we 
discuss the current therapeutic strategies to treat CDK9 malfunction in several 
disease states. Abbreviations: CDK: Cyclin-dependent kinase; Pol II: RNA

Conventional in vitro methods for biological evaluation of intra-arterial 
devices such as stents fail to accurately predict cytotoxicity and remodeling 
events. An ex vivo flow-tunable vascular bioreactor system (VesselBRx), 
comprising intra- and extra-luminal monitoring capabilities, addresses these 
limitations. VesselBRx mimics the in vivo physiological, hyperplastic, and 
cytocompatibility events of absorbable magnesium (Mg)-based stents in ex vivo 
stent-treated porcine and human coronary arteries, with in-situ and real-time 
monitoring of local stent degradation effects. Unlike conventional, static cell 
culture, the VesselBRx perfusion system eliminates unphysiologically high 
intracellular Mg2+ concentrations and localized O2 consumption resulting from 
stent degradation. Whereas static stented arteries exhibited only 20.1% cell 
viability and upregulated apoptosis, necrosis, metallic ion, and hypoxia-related 
gene signatures, stented arteries in VesselBRx showed almost identical cell 
viability to in vivo rabbit models (~94.0%). Hyperplastic intimal remodeling 
developed in unstented arteries subjected to low shear stress, but was inhibited 
by Mg-based stents in VesselBRx, similarly to in vivo. VesselBRx represents a 
critical advance from the current static culture standard of testing absorbable 
vascular implants.

Infusion of patient-derived CD19-specific chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T 
cells engineered by viral vectors achieved complete remission and durable 
response in relapsed and refractory (r/r) B-lineage neoplasms. Here, we expand 
on those findings by providing a preclinical evaluation of allogeneic non-viral 
cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells transfected with the Sleeping Beauty (SB) 
transposon CD19CAR (CARCIK-CD19). Specifically, thanks to a large-scale 18-day 
manufacturing process, it was possible to achieve stable CD19CAR expression 
(62.425 ± 6.399%) and efficient T-cell expansion (23.36 ± 3.00-fold). 
Frozen/thawed CARCIK-CD19 remained fully functional both in vitro and in an 
established patient-derived xenograft (PDX) of MLL-ENL rearranged acute 
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). CARCIK-CD19 showed a dose-dependent antitumor 
response and prolonged persistence in a PDX, bearing the feature of a 
Philadelphia-like ALL with PAX5/AUTS2 translocation, and in a survival model of 
lymphoma, achieving complete eradication of disseminated tumors. Finally, the 
infusion of CARCIK-CD19 proved to be safe and well tolerated in a 
biodistribution and toxicity model. The infused cells persisted in the 
hematopoietic and post-injection perfused organs until the end of the study and 
consisted of CD8+, CD56+, and CAR+ T cells. Overall, these findings provide 
important implications for non-viral technology and the proof-of-concept that 
donor-derived CARCIK-CD19 are indeed effective against relapsed ALL, a 
possibility that will be tested in Phase I/II clinical trials after allogeneic 
hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation.

INTRODUCTION: Despite surgical reattachment of retinal layers, postoperative 
functional outcomes after rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) may be 
limited. This can be explained by microstructural changes in the macula inherent 
to the pathology itself as well as the surgery.
PURPOSE: To evaluate the various changes in the macula by OCT pre- and 
postoperatively, and correlate them with functional and clinical outcomes in 
patients with RRD. To establish pre- and postoperative prognostic factors.
METHODS: This was a prospective study of 50 eyes of 50 patients operated for 
RDD. Each patient underwent a complete clinical examination and macular OCT 
using the Heidelberg Spectralis; preoperatively and then successively at 7 days, 
1 month, 3 months and 6 months after RRD surgery.
RESULTS: Preoperative tomographic results revealed an average height of 
submacular fluid of 742 ± 345 μm. Ninety-six percent of patients exhibited 
thickening of photoreceptor outer segments (PROS), 62% an outer layer 
undulation, 60% cystic cavities in the outer and/or inner nuclear layers (ONL, 
INL), 36% disruptions of the external limiting membrane (ELM) and 64% disruption 
of the IS/OS junction. Postoperatively, 24% of patients had persistent 
submacular fluid. The average thickness of the central fovea, the ONL, the IS/OS 
junction and the PROS were 172 ± 51.3 μm, 88.4 ± 30.9 μm, 11.36 ± 5.4 μm and 
19.54 ± 13.1 μm respectively. Postoperative disruptions of the ELM, the IS/OS 
junction and Verhoeff's membrane (VM) were present in 24%, 60% and 82% of 
patients respectively. The preoperative tomographic risk factors for poor visual 
outcome were: submacular fluid height > 800 μm (P<0.001), disruptions of the MLE 
and/or IS/OS junction (P<0.001), as well as cystic cavities in the ENL and/or 
INL (P=0.002). Postoperative risk factors were: thinning of the fovea (≤ 250 
μm), central fovea (≤ 160 μm), ONL (≤ 90 μm), IS/OS junction (≤ 10 μm) and PROS 
(≤ 18 μm) layers (P<0.001), as well as a discontinuous or absent appearance of 
the ELM (P<0.001), IS/OS junction (P<0.001) and VM (P=0.006).
CONCLUSION: Spectral domain OCT allows detection of specific microscopic, 
quasi-histologic macular changes in rhegmatogenous retinal detachment. These 
anomalies could be predictive of final postoperative visual outcome.

BACKGROUND: Neurodevelopment is orchestrated by a wide range of genes, and the 
genetic causes of neurodevelopmental disorders are thus heterogeneous. We 
applied whole exome sequencing (WES) for molecular diagnosis and in silico 
analysis to identify novel disease gene candidates in a cohort from Saudi Arabia 
with primarily Mendelian neurologic diseases.
METHODS: We performed WES in 31 mostly consanguineous Arab families and analyzed 
both single nucleotide and copy number variants (CNVs) from WES data. 
Interaction/expression network and pathway analyses, as well as paralog studies 
were utilized to investigate potential pathogenicity and disease association of 
novel candidate genes. Additional cases for candidate genes were identified 
through the clinical WES database at Baylor Miraca Genetics Laboratories and 
GeneMatcher.
RESULTS: We found known pathogenic or novel variants in known disease genes with 
phenotypic expansion in 6 families, disease-associated CNVs in 2 families, and 
12 novel disease gene candidates in 11 families, including KIF5B, GRM7, FOXP4, 
MLLT1, and KDM2B. Overall, a potential molecular diagnosis was provided by 
variants in known disease genes in 17 families (54.8 %) and by novel candidate 
disease genes in an additional 11 families, making the potential molecular 
diagnostic rate ~90 %.
CONCLUSIONS: Molecular diagnostic rate from WES is improved by exome-predicted 
CNVs. Novel candidate disease gene discovery is facilitated by paralog studies 
and through the use of informatics tools and available databases to identify 
additional evidence for pathogenicity.

Here we report the creation of a novel tracheal construct in the form of an 
engineered, acellular tissue-stent biocomposite trachea (TSBT). Allogeneic or 
xenogeneic smooth muscle cells are cultured on polyglycolic acid polymer-metal 
stent scaffold leading to the formation of a tissue comprising cells, their 
deposited collagenous matrix, and the stent material. Thorough decellularization 
then produces a final acellular tubular construct. Engineered TSBTs were tested 
as end-to-end tracheal replacements in 11 rats and 3 nonhuman primates. Over a 
period of 8 weeks, no instances of airway perforation, infection, stent 
migration, or erosion were observed. Histological analyses reveal that the 
patent implants remodel adaptively with native host cells, including formation 
of connective tissue in the tracheal wall and formation of a confluent, columnar 
epithelium in the graft lumen, although some instances of airway stenosis were 
observed. Overall, TSBTs resisted collapse and compression that often limit the 
function of other decellularized tracheal replacements, and additionally do not 
require any cells from the intended recipient. Such engineered TSBTs represent a 
model for future efforts in tracheal regeneration.

Unlike clustered HOX genes, the role of nonclustered homeobox gene family 
members in hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis has not been extensively studied. 
Here we found that the hematopoietically expressed homeobox gene Hhex is 
overexpressed in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and is essential for the 
initiation and propagation of MLL-ENL-induced AML but dispensable for normal 
myelopoiesis, indicating a specific requirement for Hhex for leukemic growth. 
Loss of Hhex leads to expression of the Cdkn2a-encoded tumor suppressors 
p16(INK4a) and p19(ARF), which are required for growth arrest and myeloid 
differentiation following Hhex deletion. Mechanistically, we show that Hhex 
binds to the Cdkn2a locus and directly interacts with the Polycomb-repressive 
complex 2 (PRC2) to enable H3K27me3-mediated epigenetic repression. Thus, Hhex 
is a potential therapeutic target that is specifically required for AML stem 
cells to repress tumor suppressor pathways and enable continued self-renewal.

Acetaminophen (APAP) toxicity is the most common drug-induced cause of acute 
liver failure in the United States. The only available treatment, 
N-acetylcysteine (NAC), has a limited time window of efficacy, indicating a need 
for additional therapeutic options. Zebrafish have emerged as a powerful tool 
for drug discovery. Here, we developed a clinically relevant zebrafish model of 
APAP toxicity. APAP depleted glutathione stores, elevated aminotransferase 
levels, increased apoptosis, and caused dose-dependent hepatocyte necrosis. 
These outcomes were limited by NAC and conserved in zebrafish embryos. In a 
targeted embryonic chemical screen, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) was identified as a 
potential therapeutic agent; in the adult, PGE2 similarly decreased 
APAP-associated toxicity. Significantly, when combined with NAC, PGE2 extended 
the time window for a successful intervention, synergistically reducing 
apoptosis, improving liver enzymes, and preventing death. Use of a wnt reporter 
zebrafish line and chemical genetic epistasis showed that the effects of PGE2 
are mediated through the wnt signaling pathway. Zebrafish can be used as a 
clinically relevant toxicological model amenable to the identification of 
additional therapeutics and biomarkers of APAP injury; our data suggest 
combinatorial PGE2 and NAC treatment would be beneficial for patients with 
APAP-induced liver damage.

The t(11;19)(q23;p13.1) chromosomal translocation in acute myeloid leukemias 
fuses the gene encoding transcriptional elongation factor ELL to the MLL gene 
with consequent expression of an MLL-ELL chimeric protein. To identify potential 
mechanisms of leukemogenesis by MLL-ELL, its transcriptional and oncogenic 
properties were investigated. Fusion with MLL preserves the transcriptional 
elongation activity of ELL but relocalizes it from a diffuse nuclear 
distribution to the nuclear bodies characteristic of MLL. Using a serial 
replating assay, it was demonstrated that the MLL-ELL chimeric protein is 
capable of immortalizing clonogenic myeloid progenitors in vitro after its 
retroviral transduction into primary murine hematopoietic cells. However, a 
structure-function analysis indicates that the elongation domain is not 
essential for myeloid transformation because mutants lacking elongation activity 
retain a potent ability to immortalize myeloid progenitors. Rather, the highly 
conserved carboxyl terminal R4 domain is both a necessary and a sufficient 
contribution from ELL for the immortalizing activity associated with MLL-ELL. 
The R4 domain demonstrates potent transcriptional activation properties and is 
required for transactivation of a HoxA7 promoter by MLL-ELL in a transient 
transcriptional assay. These data indicate that neoplastic transformation by the 
MLL-ELL fusion protein is likely to result from aberrant transcriptional 
activation of MLL target genes. Thus, in spite of the extensive diversity of MLL 
fusion partners, these data, in conjunction with previous studies of MLL-ENL, 
suggest that conversion of MLL to a constitutive transcriptional activator may 
be a general model for its oncogenic conversion in myeloid leukemias. (Blood.

The pancreatic islet is a highly vascularized micro-organ, and rapid 
revascularization postislet transplantation is important for islet survival and 
function. However, the various mechanisms involved in islet revascularization 
are not fully understood, and we currently lack good in vitro platforms to 
explore this. Our aim for this study was to generate perfusable microvascular 
networks in a microfluidic chip device, in which islets could be easily 
integrated, to establish an in vitro platform for investigations on 
islet-microvasculature interactions. We compared the ability of mesenchymal stem 
cells (MSCs) and fibroblasts to support microvascular network formation by human 
umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and human induced pluripotent stem 
cell-derived endothelial colony-forming cell in two-dimensional and 
three-dimensional models of angiogenesis, and tested the effect of different 
culture media on microvessel formation. HUVECs that were supported by MSCs 
formed patent and perfusable networks in a fibrin gel, whereas networks 
supported by fibroblasts rapidly regressed. Network morphology could be 
controlled by adjusting relative cell numbers and densities. Incorporation of 
isolated rat islets demonstrated that islets recruit local microvasculature in 
vitro, but that the microvessels did not invade islets, at least during the 
course of these studies. This in vitro microvascularization platform can provide 
a useful tool to study how various parameters affect islet integration with 
microvascular networks and could also be utilized for studies of vascularization 
of other organ systems. Impact statement To improve pancreatic islet graft 
survival and function posttransplantation, rapid and adequate revascularization 
is critical. Efforts to improve islet revascularization are demanding due to an 
insufficient understanding of the mechanisms involved in the process. We have 
applied a microfluidics platform to generate microvascular networks, and by 
incorporating pancreatic islets, we were able to study microvasculature-islet 
interactions in real time. This platform can provide a useful tool to study 
islet integration with microvascular networks, and could be utilized for studies 
of vascularization of other organ systems. Moreover, this work may be adapted 
toward developing a prevascularized islet construct for transplantation.

Chromosomal rearrangements involving the mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) gene occur 
in primary and treatment-related leukemias and confer a poor prognosis. Studies 
based primarily on mouse models have substantially advanced our understanding of 
MLL leukemia pathogenesis, but often use supraphysiological oncogene expression 
with uncertain implications for human leukemia. Genome editing using 
site-specific nucleases provides a powerful new technology for gene modification 
to potentially model human disease, however, this approach has not been used to 
re-create acute leukemia in human cells of origin comparable to disease observed 
in patients. We applied transcription activator-like effector nuclease-mediated 
genome editing to generate endogenous MLL-AF9 and MLL-ENL oncogenes through 
insertional mutagenesis in primary human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells 
(HSPCs) derived from human umbilical cord blood. Engineered HSPCs displayed 
altered in vitro growth potentials and induced acute leukemias following 
transplantation in immunocompromised mice at a mean latency of 16 weeks. The 
leukemias displayed phenotypic and morphologic similarities with patient 
leukemia blasts including a subset with mixed phenotype, a distinctive feature 
seen in clinical disease. The leukemic blasts expressed an MLL-associated 
transcriptional program with elevated levels of crucial MLL target genes, 
displayed heightened sensitivity to DOT1L inhibition, and demonstrated increased 
oncogenic potential ex vivo and in secondary transplant assays. Thus, genome 
editing to create endogenous MLL oncogenes in primary human HSPCs faithfully 
models acute MLL-rearranged leukemia and provides an experimental platform for 
prospective studies of leukemia initiation and stem cell biology in a genetic 
subtype of poor prognosis leukemia.

Recruitment of the P-TEFb kinase by HIV-1 Tat to the viral promoter triggers the 
phosphorylation and escape of RNA polymerase II from promoter-proximal pausing. 
It is unclear, however, if Tat recruits additional host factors that further 
stimulate HIV-1 transcription. Using a sequential affinity-purification scheme, 
we have identified human transcription factors/coactivators AFF4, ENL, AF9, and 
elongation factor ELL2 as components of the Tat-P-TEFb complex. Through the 
bridging functions of Tat and AFF4, P-TEFb and ELL2 combine to form a 
bifunctional elongation complex that greatly activates HIV-1 transcription. 
Without Tat, AFF4 can mediate the ELL2-P-TEFb interaction, albeit inefficiently. 
Tat overcomes this limitation by bringing more ELL2 to P-TEFb and stabilizing 
ELL2 in a process that requires active P-TEFb. The ability of Tat to enable two 
different classes of elongation factors to cooperate and coordinate their 
actions on the same polymerase enzyme explains why Tat is such a powerful 
activator of HIV-1 transcription.

BACKGROUND: A practical strategy to discover sepsis specific proteins may be to 
compare the plasma peptides and proteins from patients in the intensive care 
unit with and without sepsis. The aim was to discover proteins and/or peptides 
that show greater observation frequency and/or precursor intensity in sepsis. 
The endogenous tryptic peptides of ICU-Sepsis were compared to ICU Control, 
ovarian cancer, breast cancer, female normal, sepsis, heart attack, Alzheimer's 
and multiple sclerosis along with their institution-matched controls, female 
normals and normal samples collected directly onto ice.
METHODS: Endogenous tryptic peptides were extracted from individual sepsis and 
control EDTA plasma samples in a step gradient of acetonitrile for random and 
independent sampling by LC-ESI-MS/MS with a set of robust and sensitive linear 
quadrupole ion traps. The MS/MS spectra were fit to fully tryptic peptides 
within proteins using the X!TANDEM algorithm. The protein observation frequency 
was counted using the SEQUEST algorithm after selecting the single best charge 
state and peptide sequence for each MS/MS spectra. The protein observation 
frequency of ICU-sepsis versus ICU Control was subsequently tested by Chi square 
analysis. The average protein or peptide log10 precursor intensity was compared 
across disease and control treatments by ANOVA in the R statistical system.
RESULTS: Peptides and/or phosphopeptides of common plasma proteins such as 
ITIH3, SAA2, SAA1, and FN1 showed increased observation frequency by Chi square 
(χ2 > 9, p < 0.003) and/or precursor intensity in sepsis. Cellular gene symbols 
with large Chi square values from tryptic peptides included POTEB, CTNNA1, 
U2SURP, KIF24, NLGN2, KSR1, GTF2H1, KIT, RPS6KL1, VAV2, HSPA7, SMC2, TCEB3B, 
ZNF300, SUPV3L1, ADAMTS20, LAMB4, MCCC1, SUPT6H, SCN9A, SBNO1, EPHA1, ABLIM2, 
cB5E3.2, EPHA10, GRIN2B, HIVEP2, CCL16, TKT, LRP2 and TMF1 amongst others showed 
increased observation frequency. Similarly, increased frequency of tryptic 
phosphopeptides were observed from POM121C, SCN8A, TMED8, NSUN7, SLX4, MADD, 
DNLZ, PDE3B, UTY, DEPDC7, MTX1, MYO1E, RXRB, SYDE1, FN1, PUS7L, FYCO1, USP26, 
ACAP2, AHI1, KSR2, LMAN1, ZNF280D and SLC8A2 amongst others. Increases in mean 
precursor intensity in peptides from common plasma proteins such as ITIH3, SAA2, 
SAA1, and FN1 as well as cellular proteins such as COL24A1, POTEB, KANK1, 
SDCBP2, DNAH11, ADAMTS7, MLLT1, TTC21A, TSHR, SLX4, MTCH1, and PUS7L among 
others were associated with sepsis. The processing of SAA1 included the cleavage 
of the terminal peptide D/PNHFRPAGLPEKY from the most hydrophilic point of SAA1 
on the COOH side of the cystatin C binding that was most apparent in ICU-Sepsis 
patients compared to all other diseases and controls. Additional cleavage of 
SAA1 on the NH2 terminus side of the cystatin binding site were observed in 
ICU-Sepsis. Thus there was disease associated variation in the processing of 
SAA1 in ICU-Sepsis versus ICU controls or other diseases and controls.
CONCLUSION: Specific proteins and peptides that vary between diseases might be 
discovered by the random and independent sampling of multiple disease and 
control plasma from different hospital and clinics by LC-ESI-MS/MS for storage 
in a relational SQL Server database and analysis with the R statistical system 
that will be a powerful tool for clinical research. The processing of SAA1 may 
play an unappreciated role in the inflammatory response to Sepsis.

BACKGROUND: Critically ill patients in an intensive care setting often require 
arterial catheters for blood pressure monitoring and arterial blood collection. 
Arterial catheter failure, which manifests in both mechanical and infective 
forms, remains common. Dressing and securement inadequacies may impact this 
failure; however, the best method for dressing and securing arterial catheters 
is yet to be determined.
OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to establish the feasibility of a 
definitive randomised controlled trial comparing methods for dressing and 
securing arterial catheters and to prevent device failure in an adult intensive 
care setting.
METHODS: A pilot, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial was conducted 
between April 2017 and June 2018. Patients receiving treatment in two adult 
intensive care units (Queensland, Australia) were eligible for inclusion and 
were allocated to receive either (i) an integrated securement dressing or (ii) a 
simple polyurethane dressing (with gauze/foam), applied to their newly inserted 
arterial catheters.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes were (i) feasibility (defined by 
pre-established criteria: patient eligibility, consent, protocol adherence, 
retention, and staff acceptability) and (ii) all-cause arterial catheter failure 
(a composite of local and bloodstream infection, occlusion, dislodgement, 
infiltration/extravasation, arterial inflammation, thrombosis, and/or inaccurate 
trace). Secondary outcomes included: failure type, dwell time, dressing 
adhesion, adverse event profiles, and staff acceptability.
RESULTS: In total, 109 patients were studied (n = 53 integrated securement 
dressing; n = 56 simple polyurethane). The feasibility criterion was met by most 
patients (including rates of consent [86%], protocol adherence [93%], and 
retention [100%]); however, the criteria for patient eligibility were not met 
(73%). All-cause device failure did not differ significantly between the 
integrated securement device group (n = 12/53, 23%) and the simple polyurethane 
group (n = 6/56, 11%) (hazard ratio = 2.39, 95% confidence interval = 0.89-6.37, 
p = 0.083).
CONCLUSIONS: Findings indicate a larger study is feasible, with minor 
alterations to recruitment methods required. Arterial catheter failure remains 
unacceptably common; further research to determine optimal dressing/securement 
practices is urgently needed.

    Cell Rep Med. 2022 Jun 21;3(6):100667.

Over the last decade, sequencing of primary tumors has clarified the genetic 
underpinnings of Wilms tumor but has not affected therapy, outcome, or toxicity. 
We now sharpen our focus on relapse samples from the umbrella AREN03B2 study. We 
show that over 40% of relapse samples contain mutations in SIX1 or genes of the 
MYCN network, drivers of progenitor proliferation. Not previously seen in large 
studies of primary Wilms tumors, DIS3 and TERT are now identified as recurrently 
mutated. The analysis of primary-relapse tumor pairs suggests that 11p15 loss of 
heterozygosity (and other copy number changes) and mutations in WT1 and MLLT1 
typically occur early, but mutations in SIX1, MYCN, and WTX are late 
developments in some individuals. Most strikingly, 75% of relapse samples had 
gain of 1q, providing strong conceptual support for studying circulating tumor 
DNA in clinical trials to better detect 1q gain earlier and monitor response.

BACKGROUND: Nε-Acetylation of lysine residues, a frequently occurring 
post-translational modification, plays important functions in regulating 
physiology and metabolism. However, the information of global overview of 
protein acetylome under nitrogen-starvation/resupply in tea (Camellia sinensis) 
leaves was limited. And the full function of lysine acetylated proteins of tea 
plants in nitrogen absorption and assimilation remains unclear.
RESULTS: Here, we performed the global review of lysine acetylome in tea leaves 
under nitrogen (N)-starvation/resupply, using peptide prefractionation, 
immunoaffinity enrichment, and coupling with high sensitive LC-MS/MS combined 
with affinity purification analysis. Altogether, 2229 lysine acetylation sites 
on 1286 proteins were identified, of which 16 conserved motifs in E*KacK, Kac*K, 
Kac*R, Kac*HK, Kac*N, Kac*S, Kac*T, Kac*D, were extracted from 2180 acetylated 
peptides. Approximately, 36.76% of the acetylated lysines were located in the 
regions of ordered secondary structures. The most of the identified lysine 
acetylation proteins were located in the chloroplast (39%) and cytoplasm (29%). 
The largest group of acetylated proteins consisted of many enzymes, such as ATP 
synthase, ribosomal proteins and malate dehydrogenase [NADP], which were related 
to metabolism (38%) in the biological process. These acetylated proteins were 
mainly enriched in three primary protein complexes of photosynthesis: 
photosystem I, photosystem II and the cytochrome b6/f complex. And some 
acetylated proteins related to glycolysis and secondary metabolite biosynthesis 
were increased/decreased under N-resupply. Moreover, the PPI (protein-protein 
interaction) analysis revealed that the diverse interactions of identified 
acetylated proteins mainly involved in photosynthesis and ribosome.
CONCLUSION: The results suggested that lysine acetylated proteins might play 
regulating roles in metabolic process in tea leaves. The critical regulatory 
roles mainly involved in diverse aspects of metabolic processes, especially in 
photosynthesis, glycolysis and secondary metabolism. A lot of proteins related 
to the photosynthesis and glycolysis were found to be acetylated, including 
LHCA1, LHCA3, LHCB6, psaE, psaD, psaN, GAPDH, PEPC, ENL and petC. And some 
proteins related to flavonoids were also found to be acetylated, including PAL, 
DFR, naringenin 3-dioxygenase and CHI. The provided data may serve as important 
resources for exploring the physiological, biochemical, and genetic role of 
lysine acetylation in tea plants. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with 
identifier PXD008931.

Among the various subtypes of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), those with 
chromosomal rearrangements of the MLL oncogene (AML-MLL) have a poor prognosis. 
AML-MLL tumor cells are resistant to current genotoxic therapies because of an 
attenuated response by p53, a protein that induces cell cycle arrest and 
apoptosis in response to DNA damage. In addition to chemicals that damage DNA, 
efforts have focused on targeting DNA repair enzymes as a general 
chemotherapeutic approach to cancer treatment. Here, we found that inhibition of 
the kinase ATR, which is the primary sensor of DNA replication stress, induced 
chromosomal breakage and death of mouse AML(MLL) cells (with an MLL-ENL fusion 
and a constitutively active N-RAS independently of p53. Moreover, ATR inhibition 
as a single agent exhibited antitumoral activity, both reducing tumor burden 
after establishment and preventing tumors from growing, in an immunocompetent 
allograft mouse model of AML(MLL) and in xenografts of a human AML-MLL cell 
line. We also found that inhibition of ATM, a kinase that senses DNA 
double-strand breaks, also promoted the survival of the AML(MLL) mice. 
Collectively, these data indicated that ATR or ATM inhibition represent 
potential therapeutic strategies for the treatment of AML, especially MLL-driven 
leukemias.

of chronic renal failure.

Previous studies in experimental models of progressive renal failure have shown 
that the capacity of antihypertensive drugs to protect glomeruli from sclerosis 
is often unpredictable from their effect on systemic blood pressure. The present 
study was undertaken to ascertain whether this systemic blood 
pressure-independent structure-preserving effect of antihypertensives, 
particularly angiotensin II converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), is confined to 
the glomerulus or not, as well as whether this effect is mediated via 
angiotensin II (Ang II). The following experimental drug regimens were used in 
the rat model of subtotal nephrectomy (sNPX): so-called triple therapy [TRX; a 
combination of reserpine 5 mg/liter drinking water (DW), hydralazine 80 mg/liter 
DW and hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg/liter DW], or ACEI (either captopril, CPL, 600 
mg/liter DW, enalapril, ENL, 400 mg/liter DW or lisinopril, LSL, 200 mg/liter 
DW), or a novel Ang II receptor antagonist (Ang IIR, L-158,809, 20 mg/liter DW). 
These dosages were identified in pilot studies to be the minimum required to 
control systemic blood pressure in the early phase up to 12 weeks. In addition, 
a separate group was treated with a higher dose of L-158,809 (80 mg/liter DW) 
with equipotent systemic pressor effect. Treatment was initiated eight weeks 
after subtotal nephrectomy following renal biopsy, and animals were sacrificed 
at 16 weeks. In ACEI treated rats, carotid arterial wall thickening (WT), 
defined as ratio of media thickening to radius of outer vessel wall, was similar 
to normal age-matched control (0.073 in all ACEI treated rats, vs. 0.074 in 
normal control) and significantly less than with TRX (ratio 0.118) or untreated 
sNPX (0.130). Even more remarkably, coronary arteriole WT in ACEI-treated rats 
averaged 0.139, a value less than one half and one third of TRX (0.298) and 
untreated sNPX control (0.388), respectively. Similar results were obtained for 
mesenteric artery WT. These findings were closely paralleled by changes of 
glomerular sclerosis. In untreated sNPX control rats, glomerular sclerosis 
increased from biopsy to autopsy specimens by an average of 458%. Although TRX 
dampened the degree of increase in sclerosis to on average 212%, this protective 
effect was far less than that achieved by ACEI. In the latter, sclerosis 
increased on average only 65% from biopsy to autopsy. Although all ACEIs were 
more effective than TRX, captopril and lisinopril groups showed greatest benefit 
at these doses. Ang IIR also protected renal and extrarenal structures with 34% 
increase of sclerosis index in low dose and WT 0.088, 0.117 and 0.112, 
respectively in carotid, mesenteric and coronary arteries.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT

Chimeric oncoproteins resulting from fusion of MLL to a wide variety of 
partnering proteins cause biologically distinctive and clinically aggressive 
acute leukemias. However, the mechanism of MLL-mediated leukemic transformation 
is not fully understood. Dot1, the only known histone H3 lysine 79 (H3K79) 
methyltransferase, has been shown to interact with multiple MLL fusion partners 
including AF9, ENL, AF10, and AF17. In this study, we utilize a conditional 
Dot1l deletion model to investigate the role of Dot1 in hematopoietic progenitor 
cell immortalization by MLL fusion proteins. Western blot and mass spectrometry 
show that Dot1-deficient cells are depleted of the global H3K79 methylation 
mark. We find that loss of Dot1 activity attenuates cell viability and colony 
formation potential of cells immortalized by MLL oncoproteins but not by the 
leukemic oncoprotein E2a-Pbx1. Although this effect is most pronounced for 
MLL-AF9, we find that Dot1 contributes to the viability of cells immortalized by 
other MLL oncoproteins that are not known to directly recruit Dot1. Cells 
immortalized by MLL fusions also show increased apoptosis, suggesting the 
involvement of Dot1 in survival pathways. In summary, our data point to a 
pivotal requirement for Dot1 in MLL fusion protein-mediated leukemogenesis and 
implicate Dot1 as a potential therapeutic target.

1. The properties of GABAA receptor-mediated spontaneous IPSCs generated in 
hippocampal dentate granule neurones were analysed using whole-cell 
voltage-clamp techniques in order to explore the functional consequences of the 
low number (6-12) and close proximity of synaptic contacts made by single 
GABAergic interneurones. 2. Spontaneous IPSCs (sIPSCs) occurred with a frequency 
of 14.0 +/- 9.1 Hz (n = 31) and revealed a multi-modal positively skewed 
amplitude distribution (39.0 +/- 19.8 pA, median values). 3. The variance of 
10-90% rise times and decay kinetics between IPSCs decreased with increasing 
peak amplitude. Larger amplitude events had significantly faster rise times, 
consistent with their site of generation being proximal to the soma. The decay 
kinetics of sIPSCs did not significantly change with amplitude. 4. Large 
amplitude sIPSCs occurred singularly or in discrete bursts, repeated regularly 
at low frequency. The rising phase of such sIPSCs were multi-phasic, composed of 
clear step-like inflections that were not a product of noise. The variability 
between the rising phase of individual sIPSCs was quantified by calculating 
their standard deviation, which produced fast rising (0.22 +/- 0.05 ms time to 
peak, n = 16) functions with half-widths of 0.38 +/- 0.10 ms, which declined to 
plateaux. 5. Computer simulations demonstrated that IPSCs with properties 
similar to those recorded experimentally could be generated by the linear 
summation of groups of temporally dispersed component events. Standard deviation 
functions of the rising phase of simulated IPSCs accurately described 
distributions of the temporal dispersion of unitary components. 6. The GABA 
uptake inhibitor (R)-N[4,4-bis(3-methyl-2-thienyl)but-3-enl-yl] nipecotic acid 
(tiagabine) (10 microM, n = 12) significantly prolonged the decay of mIPSCs (6.5 
+/- 0.8 to 8.7 +/- 1.0 ms, median values) and sIPSCs (6.2 +/- 0.4 to 7.3 +/- 1.2 
ms, median values), but failed to alter the frequency of occurrence, 10-90% rise 
times or peak amplitude of events. The application of flurazepam (30 microM, n = 
7; 50 microM, n = 4) prolonged the decay of sIPSCs regardless of their 
amplitude. 7. These data indicate that sIPSCs are formed by the summation of 
unitary components that occur asynchronously and that GABA released from 
multiple sites has independent post-synaptic actions.

Decreased autophagy contributes to malignancies, however it is unclear how 
autophagy impacts on tumour growth. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an ideal 
model to address this as (i) patient samples are easily accessible, (ii) the 
hematopoietic stem and progenitor population (HSPC) where transformation occurs 
is well characterized, and (iii) loss of the key autophagy gene Atg7 in 
hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) leads to a lethal pre-leukemic 
phenotype in mice. Here we demonstrate that loss of Atg5 results in an identical 
HSPC phenotype as loss of Atg7, confirming a general role for autophagy in HSPC 
regulation. Compared to more committed/mature hematopoietic cells, healthy human 
and mouse HSCs displayed enhanced basal autophagic flux, limiting mitochondrial 
damage and reactive oxygen species in this long-lived population. Taken 
together, with our previous findings these data are compatible with autophagy 
limiting leukemic transformation. In line with this, autophagy gene losses are 
found within chromosomal regions that are commonly deleted in human AML. 
Moreover, human AML blasts showed reduced expression of autophagy genes, and 
displayed decreased autophagic flux with accumulation of unhealthy mitochondria 
indicating that deficient autophagy may be beneficial to human AML. Crucially, 
heterozygous loss of autophagy in an MLL-ENL model of AML led to increased 
proliferation in vitro, a glycolytic shift, and more aggressive leukemias in 
vivo. With autophagy gene losses also identified in multiple other malignancies, 
these findings point to low autophagy providing a general advantage for tumour 
growth.

Oncogenic Ras and p53 loss-of-function mutations are common in many advanced 
sporadic malignancies and together predict a limited responsiveness to 
conventional chemotherapy. Notably, studies in cultured cells have indicated 
that each of these genetic alterations creates a selective sensitivity to ataxia 
telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR) pathway inhibition. Here, we describe a 
genetic system to conditionally reduce ATR expression to 10% of normal levels in 
adult mice to compare the impact of this suppression on normal tissues and 
cancers in vivo. Hypomorphic suppression of ATR minimally affected normal bone 
marrow and intestinal homeostasis, indicating that this level of ATR expression 
was sufficient for highly proliferative adult tissues. In contrast, hypomorphic 
ATR reduction potently inhibited the growth of both p53-deficient fibrosarcomas 
expressing H-rasG12V and acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs) driven by MLL-ENL and 
N-rasG12D. Notably, DNA damage increased in a greater-than-additive fashion upon 
combining ATR suppression with oncogenic stress (H-rasG12V, K-rasG12D, or c-Myc 
overexpression), indicating that this cooperative genome-destabilizing 
interaction may contribute to tumor selectivity in vivo. This toxic interaction 
between ATR suppression and oncogenic stress occurred without regard to p53 
status. These studies define a level of ATR pathway inhibition in which the 
growth of malignancies harboring oncogenic mutations can be suppressed with 
minimal impact on normal tissue homeostasis, highlighting ATR inhibition as a 
promising therapeutic strategy.

Leprosy and AIDS: a review of the literature and speculations on the impact of 
CD4+ lymphocyte depletion on immunity to Mycobacterium leprae.

Miller RA.

The potent effects of HIV infection on the human immune system, the complexity 
of the host-parasite interaction in leprosy, and the paucity of current 
information on the natural history of co-infected patients makes this area a 
fertile ground for clinical and immunologic investigation. Several studies have 
now validated the prediction that there exists a large cohort of patients, 
particularly in Africa, who are concurrently infected with HIV and M. leprae. 
Sparse but tantalizing evidence suggests that infection with HIV may increase 
the incidence of leprosy among individuals with subclinical infection with M. 
leprae, either through shortening the incubation period or by increasing disease 
penetrance. Similarly, active mycobacterial disease may accelerate the course of 
HIV disease, as has been postulated to occur during concurrent infections with 
certain other viral and bacterial pathogens in HIV-positive patients. A subtle 
and complex interplay between HIV and leprosy may thus result which will impact 
the observed epidemiology of both illnesses in regions where both are prevalent. 
Possible effects of the HIV epidemic on leprosy control programs have been 
outlined by the World Health Organization and in an editorial by Turk and Rees. 
The published experience provides few guidelines for the clinical care of 
co-infected patients. The initial response to conventional therapeutic regimens 
appears to be excellent, but no follow-up data have been included. The possible 
absence of ENL in these patients would simplify care for multibacillary disease, 
if this observation is confirmed in larger field studies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 
250 WORDS)

PIP: A literature search of coinfection with HIV and leprosy retrieved 4 case 
reports, 4 epidemiologic studies, 2 primate studies, and an editorial The 1st 
case was a 43-year old male with borderline tuberculoid leprosy who was 
successfully treated with dapsone and clofazimine, but later developed Kaposi's 
sarcoma and pulmonary tuberculosis. The 2nd case was a 28-year old male from 
Martinique who had been treated with triple therapy (dapsone, rifampin, and 
clofazimine) for lepromatous disease with erythema nodosum leprosum for 9 years, 
but later developed reactive polyarthritis and 1+ bacterial index along with 
generalized lymphadenopathy with his HIV. A 3rd case was a 27-year old male who 
had been treated for cutaneous leprosy for 4 years. 5 years later he had 
polyneuropathy and palpable nerve trunks suggestive of a reversal reaction, and 
candida esophagitis with a CD4/CD8 ratio of 0.3. The 4th case was a 35-year old 
woman with BT-BB leprosy on clinical grounds, but apparent BL leprosy by 
histology. It was also noted that her granulomas had a high CD4+ lymphocyte 
count, while her circulating CD4/CD8 ratio was 0.6 with a low CD4 count of 300. 
The 4 epidemiologic series were from Zambia, Haiti, Ethiopia, and a large series 
of cases from Ivory Coast, Congo, Senegal, and Yemen. Some preliminary 
conclusions from these data were that HIV infection does not affect the clinical 
classification of leprosy, that HIV infection may confer anergy to lepromin, 
that HIV infection may cause relapse of leprosy, and that leprosy may accelerate 
the progression of HIV. There were 2 cases where leprosy grading reaction 
reversed or downgraded in coinfected patients. In the primate model, coinfection 
with SIV and M. leprae increases susceptibility of monkeys to leprosy.

BACKGROUND: The KMT2A gene, formerly named the MLL gene, is rearranged (KMT2Ar) 
in 70-75% of infants, 5-6% of children and 10-15% of adult patients with B cell 
acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). The outcome after chemotherapy of 
pediatric cases remains poor, and only a few studies have investigated the 
clinical and laboratory features, treatment response and prognosis in Chinese 
populations.
METHODS: A total of 48 B-ALL children with KMT2Ar were enrolled in the study, 
and clinical and laboratory data were collected and analyzed by age group. The 
relationship between prognosis and traditional risk factors and treatment 
response was investigated for these patients who received chemotherapy.
RESULTS: The 48 enrolled patients included 28 males and 20 females; 18 (37.50%) 
or 30 (62.50%) patients were an age of < 12 m (infant B-ALL) or of > 12 m at 
onset. An initial WBC count of 300 × 109/L was detected in 7 (14.58%) patients; 
testicular leukemia (TL) or central nervous system involvement was found in 5 
(10.41%) or 3 (6.25%) patients, respectively. Statistical differences were not 
found in the age groups of sex or initial WBC count, whereas TL was more common 
in the infant group (P < 0.05). 11q23 was detected in 18 patients; KMT2Ar was 
detected in 46 (95.83%) or 45 (93.75%) patients by FISH or multiplex RT-PCR 
technology, respectively; RNA-seq data were obtained for 18 patients, and 3 
patients with uncommon KMT2Ar were identified. KMT2A-AFF1, KMT2A-MLLT3 and 
KMT2A-MLLT1 were the most common transcripts. Statistical differences were not 
found in treatment response by age groups, including dexamethasone induction, 
bone marrow (BM) smear status and minimal residual disease (MRD) level at 
different time points (TP), treatment-related mortality (TRM), or complete 
remission (CR) rate (P > 0.05); MRD levels monitored by FCM or PCR were unequal 
at the same TP. Four patients died of treatment, and TRM was 8.33%; 40 patients 
achieved CR, and the CR rate for the cohort was 83.33%. Seven patients quit, 15 
patients relapsed, and the 5 yr cumulative relapse rate was 59.16 ± 9.16%; the 
5 yr prospective EFS (pEFS) for patients who were included or excluded from the 
TRM group was 36.86 ± 8.48% or 40.84 ± 9.16%, respectively. Multivariate 
analysis for prognosis and hazard ratio was performed for 37 patients without 
TRM and revealed that an initial WBC count of > 300 × 109/L and a positive level 
of FCM-MRD were strongly related to a poor outcome for B-ALL patients with

Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) belongs to the Pneumoviridae family and is closely 
related to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The surface fusion (F) 
glycoprotein mediates viral fusion and is the primary target of neutralizing 
antibodies against hMPV. Here we report 113 hMPV-F specific monoclonal 
antibodies (mAbs) isolated from memory B cells of human donors. We characterize 
the antibodies' germline usage, epitopes, neutralization potencies, and binding 
specificities. We find that unlike RSV-F specific mAbs, antibody responses to 
hMPV F are less dominant against the apex of the antigen, and the majority of 
the potent neutralizing mAbs recognize epitopes on the side of hMPV F. 
Furthermore, neutralizing epitopes that differ from previously defined antigenic 
sites on RSV F are identified, and multiple binding modes of site V and II mAbs 
are discovered. Interestingly, mAbs that bind preferentially to the unprocessed 
prefusion F show poor neutralization potency. These results elucidate the immune 
recognition of hMPV infection and provide novel insights for future hMPV 
antibody and vaccine development.

Leukemia phenotypes vary with age of onset. Delineating mechanisms of age 
specificity in leukemia could improve disease models and uncover new therapeutic 
approaches. Here, we used heterochronic transplantation of leukemia driven by 
MLL/KMT2A translocations to investigate the contribution of the age of the 
hematopoietic microenvironment to age-specific leukemia phenotypes. When driven 
by MLL-AF9, leukemia cells in the adult microenvironment sustained a myeloid 
phenotype, whereas the neonatal microenvironment supported genesis of mixed 
early B cell/myeloid leukemia. In MLL-ENL leukemia, the neonatal 
microenvironment potentiated B-lymphoid differentiation compared with the adult. 
Ccl5 elaborated from adult marrow stroma inhibited B-lymphoid differentiation of 
leukemia cells, illuminating a mechanism of age-specific lineage commitment. Our 
study illustrates the contribution of the developmental stage of the 
hematopoietic microenvironment in defining the age specificity of leukemia.

Members of the bromodomain and extra-terminal domain (BET) family of proteins 
(bromodomain-containing (BRD) 2, 3, 4, and T) are widely expressed and highly 
conserved regulators of gene expression in eukaryotes. These proteins have been 
intimately linked to human disease, and more than a dozen clinical trials are 
currently underway to test BET-protein inhibitors as modulators of cancer. 
However, although it is clear that these proteins use their bromodomains to bind 
both histones and transcription factors bearing acetylated lysine residues, the 
molecular mechanisms by which BET family proteins regulate gene expression are 
not well defined. In particular, the functions of the other domains such as the 
ET domain have been less extensively studied. Here, we examine the properties of 
the ET domain of BRD3 as a protein/protein interaction module. Using a 
combination of pulldown and biophysical assays, we demonstrate that BRD3 binds 
to a range of chromatin-remodeling complexes, including the NuRD, BAF, and INO80 
complexes, via a short linear "KIKL" motif in one of the complex subunits. 
NMR-based structural analysis revealed that, surprisingly, this mode of 
interaction is shared by the AF9 and ENL transcriptional coregulators that 
contain an acetyl-lysine-binding YEATS domain and regulate transcriptional 
elongation. This observation establishes a functional commonality between these 
two families of cancer-related transcriptional regulators. In summary, our data 
provide insight into the mechanisms by which BET family proteins might link 
chromatin acetylation to transcriptional outcomes and uncover an unexpected 
functional similarity between BET and YEATS family proteins.

MLL is involved in chromosomal rearrangements that generate fusion proteins with 
deregulated transcriptional activity. The mechanisms of MLL fusion 
protein-mediated transcriptional activation are poorly understood. Here we show 
MLL interacts directly with the polymerase associated factor complex (PAFc) 
through sequences flanking the CxxC domain. PAFc interacts with RNA polymerase 
II and stimulates posttranslational histone modifications. PAFc augments MLL and 
MLL-AF9 mediated transcriptional activation of Hoxa9. Conversely, knockdown of 
PAFc disrupts MLL fusion protein-mediated transcriptional activation and MLL 
recruitment to target loci. PAFc gene expression is downregulated during 
hematopoiesis and likely serves to regulate MLL function. Deletions of MLL that 
abolish interactions with PAFc also eliminate MLL-AF9 mediated immortalization 
indicating an essential function for this interaction in leukemogenesis.

The recombinant, live, attenuated, tetravalent dengue vaccine CYD-TDV has shown 
efficacy against all four dengue serotypes. In this exploratory study (CYD59, 
NCT02827162), we evaluated potential associations of host human leukocyte 
antigen (HLA) alleles with dengue antibody responses, CYD-TDV vaccine efficacy, 
and virologically-confirmed dengue (VCD) cases. Children 4-11 years old, who 
previously completed a phase 2b efficacy study of CYD-TDV in a single center in 
Thailand, were included in the study. Genotyping of HLA class I and II loci was 
performed by next-generation sequencing from DNA obtained from 335 saliva 
samples. Dengue neutralizing antibody titers (NAb) were assessed as a correlate 
of risk and protection. Regression analyses were used to assess associations 
between HLA alleles and NAb responses, vaccine efficacy, and dengue outcomes. 
Month 13 NAb log geometric mean titers (GMTs) were associated with decreased 
risk of VCD. In the vaccine group, HLA-DRB1*11 was significantly associated with 
higher NAb log GMT levels (beta: 0.76; p = 0.002, q = 0.13). Additionally, in 
the absence of vaccination, HLA associations were observed between the presence 
of DPB1*03:01 and increased NAb log GMT levels (beta: 1.24; p = 0.005, 
q = 0.17), and between DPB1*05:01 and reduced NAb log GMT levels (beta: -1.1; 
p = 0.001, q = 0.07). This study suggests associations of HLA alleles with NAb 
titers in the context of dengue outcomes. This study was registered with 
clinicaltrials.gov: NCT02827162.

Cell-based therapies have shown promise for treating myriad chronic pulmonary 
diseases through direct application of epithelial progenitors or by way of 
engineered tissue grafts or whole organs. To elucidate environmental effects on 
epithelial regenerative outcomes in vitro, here, we isolate and culture a 
population of pharmacologically expanded basal cells (peBCs) from rat tracheas. 
At peak basal marker expression, we simultaneously split peBCs into 
four in vitro platforms: organoid, air-liquid interface (ALI), engineered 
trachea, and engineered lung. Following differentiation, these samples are 
evaluated using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and computational 
pipelines are developed to compare samples both globally and at the population 
level. A sample of native rat tracheal epithelium is also evaluated by scRNA-seq 
as a control for engineered epithelium. Overall, this work identifies 
platform-specific effects that support the use of engineered models to achieve 
the most physiologic differential outcomes in pulmonary epithelial regenerative 
applications.

The chromosomal translocation t(4;11) marks an infant acute lymphoblastic 
leukemia associated with dismal prognosis. This rearrangement leads to the 
synthesis of the MLL-AF4 chimera, which exerts its oncogenic activity by 
upregulating transcription of genes involved in hematopoietic differentiation. 
Crucial for chimera's aberrant activity is the recruitment of the AF4/ENL/P-TEFb 
protein complex. Interestingly, a molecular interactor of AF4 is fibroblast 
growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2). We herein analyze the role of FGFR2 in the 
context of leukemia using t(4;11) leukemia cell lines. We revealed the 
interaction between MLL-AF4 and FGFR2 by immunoprecipitation, western blot, and 
immunofluorescence experiments; we also tested the effects of FGFR2 knockdown, 
FGFR2 inhibition, and FGFR2 stimulation on the expression of the main MLL-AF4 
target genes, i.e., HOXA9 and MEIS1. Our results show that FGFR2 and MLL-AF4 
interact in the nucleus of leukemia cells and that FGFR2 knockdown, which is 
associated with decreased expression of HOXA9 and MEIS1, impairs the binding of 
MLL-AF4 to the HOXA9 promoter. We also show that stimulation of leukemia cells 
with FGF2 increases nuclear level of FGFR2 in its phosphorylated form, as well 
as HOXA9 and MEIS1 expression. In contrast, preincubation with the ATP-mimetic 
inhibitor PD173074, before FGF2 stimulation, reduced FGFR2 nuclear amount and 
HOXA9 and MEIS1 transcript level, thereby indicating that MLL-AF4 aberrant 
activity depends on the nuclear availability of FGFR2. Overall, our study 
identifies FGFR2 as a new and promising therapeutic target in t(4;11) leukemia.

Efficacy trials, designed to gain regulatory marketing approval, evaluate drugs 
in optimally selected patients under advantageous conditions for relatively 
short time periods. Effectiveness trials, designed to evaluate use in usual 
practice, assess treatments among more typical patients in real-world conditions 
with longer follow-up periods. In "efficacy-to-effectiveness (E2E) trials," if 
the initial efficacy trial component is positive, the trial seamlessly 
transitions to an effectiveness trial component to efficiently yield both types 
of evidence. Yet more time could be saved by simultaneously addressing efficacy 
and effectiveness in an "efficacy and effectiveness too (EE2) trial." 
Additionally, hybrids of the E2E and EE2 approaches with differing degrees of 
overlap of the two components could allow flexibility for specific drug 
development needs. In planning EE2 trials, each stakeholder's current and future 
needs, incentives, and perspective must be considered. Although challenging, the 
ultimate benefits to stakeholders, the health system, and the public should 
justify this effort.

The pathogen Mycobacterium leprae causes leprosy that affects mainly skin and 
nerves. Polymorphisms of certain genes are substantiated to be associated with 
the susceptibility/resistance to leprosy. The present investigation addressed 
the association of Nitric Oxide Synthase2 gene polymorphisms and leprosy in a 
population from northern part of India. A total of 323 leprosy cases and 288 
healthy controls were genotyped for four NOS2 promoter variants (rs1800482, 
rs2779249, rs8078340 and rs2301369) using FRET technology in Real Time PCR. None 
of these SNPs in promoter sites was associated with susceptibility/resistance to 
leprosy. NOS2 rs1800482 was found to be monomorphic with GG genotype. However, 
NOS2-1026T allele was observed to be in higher frequency with leprosy cases (BL 
and LL) who were not suffering from any reactional episodes compared to cases 
with ENL reaction {OR=0.30, 95% CI (0.10-0.86), p=0.024}. NOS2-1026GT genotype 
was more prevalent in cases without reaction (BT, BB and BL) compared to RR 
reactional patients {OR=0.38, 95% CI (0.17-0.86), p=0.02}. Although haplotype 
analysis revealed that no haplotype was associated with leprosy 
susceptibility/resistance with statistical significance, GTG haplotype was noted 
to be more frequent in healthy controls. These SNPs are observed to be in 
linkage disequilibrium. Although, these SNPs are not likely to influence leprosy 
vulnerability, -1026G>T SNP was indicated to have noteworthy role in leprosy 
reactions.

Melanoma differentiation associated gene-7 (mda-7)/interleukin-24 (IL-24), a 
member of the IL-10 cytokine gene family, preferentially induces cell death in 
neoplastic epithelial cells types while sparing their normal counterparts. The 
effects of mda-7/IL-24 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells have not been 
extensively characterized. Treatment with recombinant GST-MDA-7/IL-24 potently 
induced apoptosis in diverse myeloid leukemia cell types including U937, HL60, 
MV4-11, EOL-1, and MLL/ENL cells. MDA-7/IL-24 also markedly induced apoptosis in 
and suppressed the colony-forming capacity of primary AML blasts but exerted 
minimal toxicity toward normal CD34(+) hematopoietic progenitor cells. 
MDA-7/IL-24 lethality was associated with pronounced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 
stress induction in leukemia cell lines and primary AML blasts, manifested by 
the accumulation of growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible protein 34 (GADD34), 
78-kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78)/BiP, inositol-requiring enzyme 1α 
(IRE1α), and eukaryotic initiation factor 2α phosphorylation. It is noteworthy 
that short hairpin RNA (shRNA) knockdown of IRE1α, GADD34, or GRP78/BiP 
significantly enhanced MDA-7/IL-24-mediated apoptosis, indicating a protective 
role for these molecules against MDA-7/IL-24 lethality. MDA-7/IL-24 also 
down-regulated the antiapoptotic protein Mcl-1 and sharply increased expression 
of the proapoptotic proteins Bim and Noxa. Ectopic Mcl-1 expression or shRNA 
knockdown of Bim or Noxa significantly attenuated MDA-7/IL-24-mediated leukemia 
cell death. Finally, knockdown of Bax or Bak significantly reduced MDA-7/IL-24 
lethality. Together, these findings indicate that MDA-7/IL-24 potently induces 
apoptosis in human myeloid leukemia cells through a process regulated by ER 
stress induction, Mcl-1 down-regulation, and Bim and Noxa up-regulation. They 
also suggest that MDA-7/IL-24 warrants further investigation in myeloid 
leukemia.

Tumors are composed of heterogeneous phenotypes, each having different 
sensitivities to the microenvironment. One microenvironment characteristic - 
matrix stiffness - helps to regulate malignant transformation and invasion in 
mammary tumors, but its influence on oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is 
unclear. We observed that, on stiff matrices, a highly invasive OSCC cell line 
(SCC25) comprising a low E-cad to N-cad ratio (InvH/E:NL; SCC25) had increased 
migration velocity and decreased adhesion strength compared to a less invasive 
OSCC cell line (Cal27) with high E-cad to N-cad ratio (InvL/E:NH; Cal27). 
However, InvL/E:NH cells acquire a mesenchymal signature and begin to migrate 
faster when exposed to prolonged time on a stiff niche, suggesting that cells 
can be mechanically conditioned. Owing to increased focal adhesion assembly, 
InvL/E:NH cells migrated faster, which could be reduced when increasing integrin 
affinity with high divalent cation concentrations. Mirroring these data in human 
patients, we observed that collagen organization, an indicator of matrix 
stiffness, was increased with advanced disease and correlated with early 
recurrence. Consistent with epithelial tumors, our data suggest that OSCC cells 
are mechanically sensitive and that their contribution to tumor progression is 
mediated in part by this sensitivity.This article has an associated First Person 
interview with the first author of the paper.

CONTEXT: Sotos syndrome is a rare genetic disorder with a distinct phenotypic 
spectrum including overgrowth and learning difficulties. Here we describe a new 
case of Sotos syndrome with a 5q35 microdeletion, affecting the fibroblast 
growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4) gene, presenting with infantile hypercalcemia.
OBJECTIVE: We strove to elucidate the evanescent nature of the observed 
hypercalcemia by studying the ontogenesis of FGFR3 and FGFR4, which are both 
associated with fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 23-mediated mineral homeostasis, 
in the developing human kidney.
DESIGN: Quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemical analyses were used on 
archival human kidney samples to investigate the expression of the FGFR 
signaling pathway during renal development.
RESULTS: We demonstrated that renal gene and protein expression of both FGFRs 
increased during fetal development between the gestational ages (GAs) of 14-40 
weeks. Yet FGFR4 expression increased more rapidly as compared with FGFR3 (slope 
0.047 vs 0.0075, P = .0018). Moreover, gene and protein expression of the 
essential FGFR coreceptor, Klotho, also increased with a significant positive 
correlation between FGFR and Klotho mRNA expression during renal development. 
Interestingly, we found that perinatal FGFR4 expression (GA 38-40 wk) was 7-fold 
higher as compared with FGFR3 (P = .0035), whereas in adult kidney tissues, 
FGFR4 gene expression level was more than 2-fold lower compared with FGFR3 (P = 
.0029), thus identifying a molecular developmental switch of FGFR isoforms.
CONCLUSION: We propose that the heterozygous FGFR4 deletion, as observed in the 
Sotos syndrome patient, leads to a compromised FGF23 signaling during infancy 
accounting for transient hypercalcemia. These findings represent a novel and 
intriguing view on FGF23 mediated calcium homeostasis.

We performed genome-wide sequencing and analyzed mRNA and miRNA expression, DNA 
copy number, and DNA methylation in 117 Wilms tumors, followed by targeted 
sequencing of 651 Wilms tumors. In addition to genes previously implicated in 
Wilms tumors (WT1, CTNNB1, AMER1, DROSHA, DGCR8, XPO5, DICER1, SIX1, SIX2, 
MLLT1, MYCN, and TP53), we identified mutations in genes not previously 
recognized as recurrently involved in Wilms tumors, the most frequent being 
BCOR, BCORL1, NONO, MAX, COL6A3, ASXL1, MAP3K4, and ARID1A. DNA copy number 
changes resulted in recurrent 1q gain, MYCN amplification, LIN28B gain, and 
MIRLET7A loss. Unexpected germline variants involved PALB2 and CHEK2. Integrated 
analyses support two major classes of genetic changes that preserve the 
progenitor state and/or interrupt normal development.

The histone variant H2A.Z is essential for maintaining embryonic stem cell (ESC) 
identity in part by keeping developmental genes in a poised bivalent state. 
However, how H2A.Z is deposited into the bivalent domains remains unknown. In 
mammals, two chromatin remodeling complexes, Tip60/p400 and SRCAP, exchange the 
canonical histone H2A for H2A.Z in the chromatin. Here we show that Glioma 
Amplified Sequence 41 (Gas41), a shared subunit of the two H2A.Z-depositing 
complexes, functions as a reader of histone lysine acetylation and recruits 
Tip60/p400 and SRCAP to deposit H2A.Z into specific chromatin regions including 
bivalent domains. The YEATS domain of Gas41 bound to acetylated histone H3K27 
and H3K14 both in vitro and in cells. The crystal structure of the Gas41 YEATS 
domain in complex with the H3K27ac peptide revealed that, similar to the AF9 and 
ENL YEATS domains, Gas41 YEATS forms a serine-lined aromatic cage for 
acetyllysine recognition. Consistently, mutations in the aromatic residues of 
the Gas41 YEATS domain abrogated the interaction. In mouse ESCs, knockdown of 
Gas41 led to flattened morphology of ESC colonies, as the result of derepression 
of differentiation genes. Importantly, the abnormal morphology was rescued by 
expressing wild-type Gas41, but not the YEATS domain mutated counterpart that 
does not recognize histone acetylation. Mechanically, we found that Gas41 
depletion led to reduction of H2A.Z levels and a concomitant reduction of 
H3K27me3 levels on bivalent domains. Together, our study reveals an essential 
role of the Gas41 YEATS domain in linking histone acetylation to H2A.Z 
deposition and maintenance of ESC identity.

OBJECTIVE: The porcine arteriovenous graft model is commonly used to study 
hemodialysis vascular access failure, with most studies using a bilateral, 
paired-site approach in either the neck or femoral vessels. In humans, left- and 
right-sided central veins have different anatomy and diameters, and left-sided 
central vein catheters have worse outcomes. We assessed the effect of laterality 
on arteriovenous prosthetic graft patency and hypothesized that left-sided 
carotid-jugular arteriovenous prosthetic grafts have reduced patency in the 
porcine model.
METHODS: Arteriovenous polytetrafluoroethylene grafts were placed ipsilaterally 
or bilaterally in 10 Yorkshire male pigs from the common carotid artery to the 
internal jugular vein. Ultrasound measurements of blood flow velocities and 
diameters were assessed before graft placement. Animals were sacrificed at 
1 week, 2 weeks, or 3 weeks. Patency was determined clinically; grafts and 
perianastomotic vessels were excised and analyzed with histology and 
immunostaining.
RESULTS: At baseline, left- and right-sided veins and arteries had similar blood 
flow velocities. Although internal jugular veins had similar diameters at 
baseline, left-sided carotid arteries had 11% smaller outer diameters (P = 
.0354). There were 10 left-sided and 8 right-sided polytetrafluoroethylene 
grafts placed; only 4 of 10 (40%) grafts were patent on the left compared with 7 
of 8 (88%) grafts patent on the right (P = .04). Left-sided grafts had increased 
macrophages at the arterial anastomosis (P = .0007). Left-sided perianastomotic 
arteries had thicker walls (0.74 vs 0.60 mm; P = .0211) with increased 
intima-media area (1.14 vs 0.77 mm2; P = .0169) as well as a trend toward 38% 
smaller luminal diameter (1.6 vs 2.5 mm; P = .0668) and 20% smaller outer 
diameter (3.0 vs 3.7 mm; P = .0861). Left- and right-sided perianastomotic veins 
were similar histologically, but left-sided veins had decreased expression of 
phosphorylated endothelial nitric oxide synthase (P = .0032) and increased 
numbers of α-actin-positive smooth muscle cells (P = .0022).
CONCLUSIONS: Left-sided arteriovenous grafts are associated with reduced 
short-term patency compared with right-sided grafts in the Yorkshire pig 
preclinical model of arteriovenous prosthetic grafts. Laterality must be 
considered in planning and interpreting surgical preclinical models.

BACKGROUND: Peripheral intravenous catheters (PIVCs) are ubiquitous in acute 
care settings however failure rates are unacceptably high, with around half 
failing before prescribed treatment is complete. The most effective dressing and 
securement option to prolong PIVC longevity is unclear.
OBJECTIVES: To determine feasibility of conducting a definitive randomized 
controlled trial (RCT) investigating evidence-based securement bundles (medical 
adhesive tapes and supplementary securement products) to reduce PIVC failure.
METHODS: In this pilot non-masked 3-group RCT, adults requiring a PIVC for 
>24 hrs were randomized to Standard care (bordered polyurethane dressing plus 
non-sterile tape over extension tubing), Securement Bundle 1 (two sterile tape 
strips over PIVC hub plus Standard care) or Securement Bundle 2 (Bundle 1 plus 
tubular bandage) with allocation concealed until study entry.
EXCLUSIONS: laboratory-confirmed positive blood culture, current/high-risk of 
skin tear, or study product allergy.
PRIMARY OUTCOME: feasibility (eligibility, recruitment, retention, protocol 
fidelity, participant/staff satisfaction).
SECONDARY OUTCOMES: PIVC failure, PIVC dwell time, adverse skin events, PIVC 
colonization and cost.
RESULTS: Of 109 randomized participants, 104 were included in final analyses. 
Feasibility outcomes were met, except eligibility criterion (79%). Absolute PIVC 
failure was 38.2% (13/34) for Bundle 2, 25% (9/36) for Bundle 1 and 23.5% (8/34) 
for Standard care. Incidence rate ratio for PIVC failure/1000 catheter days, 
compared to Standard care, was 1.1 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.4-2.7) and 
2.1 (95% CI 0.9-5.1) for Bundles 1 and 2, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: A large RCT testing securement bundles is feasible, with adjustment 
to screening processes. Innovative dressing and securement solutions are needed 
to reduce unacceptable PIVC failure rates. Trial registration

OBJECTIVES: Exploring associations between the gut microbiota and colonic 
inflammation and assessing sequential changes during exclusive enteral nutrition 
(EEN) may offer clues into the microbial origins of Crohn's disease (CD).
METHODS: Fecal samples (n=117) were collected from 23 CD and 21 healthy 
children. From CD children fecal samples were collected before, during EEN, and 
when patients returned to their habitual diets. Microbiota composition and 
functional capacity were characterized using sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene and 
shotgun metagenomics.
RESULTS: Microbial diversity was lower in CD than controls before EEN (P=0.006); 
differences were observed in 36 genera, 141 operational taxonomic units (OTUs), 
and 44 oligotypes. During EEN, the microbial diversity of CD children further 
decreased, and the community structure became even more dissimilar than that of 
controls. Every 10 days on EEN, 0.6 genus diversity equivalents were lost; 34 
genera decreased and one increased during EEN. Fecal calprotectin correlated 
with 35 OTUs, 14 of which accounted for 78% of its variation. OTUs that 
correlated positively or negatively with calprotectin decreased during EEN. The 
microbiota of CD patients had a broader functional capacity than healthy 
controls, but diversity decreased with EEN. Genes involved in membrane 
transport, sulfur reduction, and nutrient biosynthesis differed between patients 
and controls. The abundance of genes involved in biotin (P=0.005) and thiamine 
biosynthesis decreased (P=0.017), whereas those involved in 
spermidine/putrescine biosynthesis (P=0.031), or the shikimate pathway 
(P=0.058), increased during EEN.
CONCLUSIONS: Disease improvement following treatment with EEN is associated with 
extensive modulation of the gut microbiome.

Chromosomal rearrangements of the mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene occur in 
∼10% of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) and define a group of 
patients with dismal outcomes. Immunohistochemical staining of bone marrow 
biopsies from most of these patients revealed aberrant expression of BCL6, a 
transcription factor that promotes oncogenic B-cell transformation and drug 
resistance in B-ALL. Our genetic and ChIP-seq (chromatin immunoprecipitation 
[ChIP] combined with high-throughput sequencing) analyses showed that MLL-AF4 
and MLL-ENL fusions directly bound to the BCL6 promoter and up-regulated BCL6 
expression. While oncogenic MLL fusions strongly induced aberrant BCL6 
expression in B-ALL cells, germline MLL was required to up-regulate Bcl6 in 
response to physiological stimuli during normal B-cell development. Inducible 
expression of Bcl6 increased MLL mRNA levels, which was reversed by genetic 
deletion and pharmacological inhibition of Bcl6, suggesting a positive feedback 
loop between MLL and BCL6. Highlighting the central role of BCL6 in 
MLL-rearranged B-ALL, conditional deletion and pharmacological inhibition of 
BCL6 compromised leukemogenesis in transplant recipient mice and restored 
sensitivity to vincristine chemotherapy in MLL-rearranged B-ALL patient samples. 
Oncogenic MLL fusions strongly induced transcriptional activation of the 
proapoptotic BH3-only molecule BIM, while BCL6 was required to curb MLL-induced 
expression of BIM. Notably, peptide (RI-BPI) and small molecule (FX1) BCL6 
inhibitors derepressed BIM and synergized with the BH3-mimetic ABT-199 in 
eradicating MLL-rearranged B-ALL cells. These findings uncover MLL-dependent 
transcriptional activation of BCL6 as a previously unrecognized requirement of 
malignant transformation by oncogenic MLL fusions and identified BCL6 as a novel 
target for the treatment of MLL-rearranged B-ALL.

Development of autologous tissue-engineered vascular constructs using vascular 
smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells 
(iPSCs) holds great potential in treating patients with vascular disease. 
However, preclinical, large animal iPSC-based cellular and tissue models are 
required to evaluate safety and efficacy prior to clinical application. Herein, 
swine iPSC (siPSC) lines were established by introducing doxycycline-inducible 
reprogramming factors into fetal fibroblasts from a line of inbred Massachusetts 
General Hospital miniature swine that accept tissue and organ transplants 
without immunosuppression within the line. Highly enriched, functional VSMCs 
were derived from siPSCs based on addition of ascorbic acid and inactivation of 
reprogramming factor via doxycycline withdrawal. Moreover, siPSC-VSMCs seeded 
onto biodegradable polyglycolic acid (PGA) scaffolds readily formed vascular 
tissues, which were implanted subcutaneously into immunodeficient mice and 
showed further maturation revealed by expression of the mature VSMC marker, 
smooth muscle myosin heavy chain. Finally, using a robust cellular self-assembly 
approach, we developed 3D scaffold-free tissue rings from siPSC-VSMCs that 
showed comparable mechanical properties and contractile function to those 
developed from swine primary VSMCs. These engineered vascular constructs, 
prepared from doxycycline-inducible inbred siPSCs, offer new opportunities for 
preclinical investigation of autologous human iPSC-based vascular tissues for 
patient treatment.

BACKGROUND: B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) is a cell-surface receptor of the 
tumour necrosis superfamily required for plasma cell survival. BMCA is 
universally detected on patient-derived myeloma cells and has emerged as a 
selective antigen to be targeted by novel treatments in multiple myeloma. We 
assessed the safety, tolerability, and preliminary clinical activity of 
GSK2857916, a novel anti-BCMA antibody conjugated to microtubule-disrupting 
agent monomethyl auristatin F, in patients with relapsed and refractory multiple 
myeloma.
METHODS: We did an international, multicentre, open-label, first-in-human phase 
1 study with dose escalation (part 1) and dose expansion (part 2) phases, at 
nine centres in the USA, Canada, and the UK. Adults with histologically or 
cytologically confirmed multiple myeloma, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 
performance status 0 or 1, and progressive disease after stem cell 
transplantation, alkylators, proteasome inhibitors, and immunomodulators were 
recruited for this study. In part 1, patients received GSK2857916 (0·03-4·60 
mg/kg) through 1 h intravenous infusions once every 3 weeks. In part 2, patients 
received the selected recommended phase 2 dose of GSK2857916 (3·40 mg/kg) once 
every 3 weeks. Primary endpoints were maximum tolerated dose and recommended 
phase 2 dose. Secondary endpoints for part 2 included preliminary anti-cancer 
clinical activity. All patients who received one or more doses were included in 
this prespecified administrative interim analysis (data cutoff date June 26, 
2017), which was done for internal purposes. This study is registered with 
ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02064387, and is ongoing, but closed for 
recruitment.
FINDINGS: Between July 29, 2014, and Feb 21, 2017, we treated 73 patients: 38 
patients in the dose-escalation part 1 and 35 patients in the dose-expansion 
part 2. There were no dose-limiting toxicities and no maximum tolerated dose was 
identified in part 1. On the basis of safety and clinical activity, we selected 
3·40 mg/kg as the recommended phase 2 dose. Corneal events were common (20 [53%] 
of 38 patients in part 1 and 22 [63%] of 35 in part 2); most (18 [47%] in part 1 
and 19 [54%] in part 2) were grade 1 or 2 and resulted in two treatment 
discontinuations in part 1 and no discontinuations in part 2. The most common 
grade 3 or 4 events were thrombocytopenia (13 [34%] of 38 patients in part 1 and 
12 [34%] of 35 in part 2) and anaemia (6 [16%] in part 1 and 5 [14%] in part 2). 
There were 12 treatment-related serious adverse events and no treatment-related 
deaths. In part 2, 21 (60·0%; 95% CI 42·1-76·1) of 35 patients achieved an 
overall response.
INTERPRETATION: At the identified recommended phase 2 dose, GSK2857916 was well 
tolerated and had good clinical activity in heavily pretreated patients, thereby 
indicating that this might be a promising candidate for the treatment of 
relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.

analysed 216 samples collected over 6 months from six different locations along 
the Homa Bay Pier. The six sampling locations comprised of three sites (P3, P5, 
P6) located <500 m from a local sewage treatment plant and pit latrines while 
three other sites (P1, P2, P4) were located at approximately 0.5 to 3 Km. EVs 
were concentrated using glass wool adsorption elution protocol and identified 
using the nested reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The odds ratio 
was performed to determine whether the location of the sources of sewage 
pollution near the lake was associated with the EVs contamination. Five out of 
108 (5 %) samples collected from the sites (P3, P5 and P6 were EV positive, 
while 2 % (2/108) of samples from P1, P2 and P4 were EV positive. The presence 
of the EVs was associated with the distance from the possible sources of faecal 
contamination (odds ratio 20.28 and 4.86, confidence interval 2.42, and 0.95) 
for pit latrines and the sewage treatment plant respectively. The result from 
this study indicates that sewage discharge at the shoreline of Lake Victoria may 
have been the source of EVs contamination. Data from this study could 
significantly contribute to informing risk management on sewage pollution in 
Lake Victoria and it is important to continue monitoring this lake for 
potentially pathogenic enteric viruses.

BACKGROUND: Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is characterized by elevated 
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels and increased cardiovascular 
disease (CVD) risk. FH patients often have increased lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] 
levels, which further increase CVD risk. Novel methods for accurately 
calculating LDL-C have been proposed.
METHODS: Patients with FH were recruited by a network of Greek sites 
participating in the HELLAS-FH registry. LDL-C levels were calculated using the 
Friedewald (LDL-CF) and the Martin/Hopkins (LDL-CM/H) equations as well as after 
correcting LDL-CM/H for Lp(a) levels [LDL-CLp(a)corM/H]. The objective was to 
compare LDL-C levels and target achievement as estimated by different methods in 
FH patients.
RESULTS: This analysis included 1620 patients (1423 adults and 197 children). In 
adults at diagnosis, LDL-CF and LDL-CM/H levels were similar [235 ± 70 mg/dL 
(6.1 ± 1.8 mmol/L) vs 235 ± 69 mg/dL (6.1 ± 1.8 mmol/L), respectively; P = NS], 
while LDL-CLp(a)corM/H levels were non-significantly lower than LDL-CF 
[211 ± 61 mg/dL (5.5 ± 1.6 mmol/L); P = 0.432]. In treated adults (n = 966) both 
LDL-CF [150 ± 71 mg/dL (3.9 ± 1.8 mmol/L)] and LDL-CM/H levels [151 ± 70 mg/dL 
(6.1 ± 1.8 mmol/L); P = 0.746] were similar, whereas LDL-CLp(a)corM/H levels 
were significantly lower than LDL-CF [121 ± 62 mg/dL (3.1 ± 1.6 mmol/L); 
P < 0.001]. Target achievement as per latest guidelines in treated patients 
using the LDL-CM/H (2.5%) and especially LDL-CLp(a)corM/H methods (10.7%) were 
significantly different than LDL-CF (2.9%; P < 0.001). In children, all 3 
formulas resulted in similar LDL-C levels, both at diagnosis and in treated 
patients. However, target achievement by LDL-CF was lower compared with LDL-CM/H 
and LDL-CLp(a)corM/H methods (22.1 vs 24.8 vs 33.3%; P < 0.001 for both 
comparisons).
CONCLUSION: LDL-CLp(a)corM/H results in significantly lower values and higher 
target achievement rate in both treated adults and children. If validated in 
clinical trials, LDL-CLp(a)corM/H may become the method of choice to more 
accurately estimate 'true' LDL-C levels in FH patients.

BACKGROUND: The study aimed to observe the effects of a Twinlight laser on the 
titanium surface proliferation of inflammatory Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), 
inflammatory cytokine expression, and osteogenic differentiation.
METHODS: The MSCs were collected from bone tissue of healthy individuals.The 
cellular inflammatory model was established with 1 μg/mL lipopolysaccharide 
(LPS).Under the cellular inflammatory model,divided into five groups: the normal 
control group (C); the inflammatory control group (L); Er:YAG laser group 
(L + E); Nd:YAG laser group (L + N); Er:YAG laser and Nd:YAG laser group 
(L + E + N). The treated cells were inoculated onto titanium disks.The normal 
and inflammatory MSCs on the surface of titanium surface were examined by CCK-8, 
scanning election microscopy (SEM), quantitative real-time polymerase chain 
reaction (qRT‑PCR) and other methods for their proliferation, growth pattern, 
expression of inflammatory factors Interleukin-6 (IL-6), Interleukin-8 (IL-8) 
and osteogenic genes Runx2 (Runt-related transcription factor 2) and alkaline 
phosphatase (ALP), providing the theoretical basis and experimental data for the 
Twinlight laser-assisted treatment of peri-implantitis. Statistical analyses 
were performed using a Student's t test with SPSS 17.0 software.
RESULTS: Through observation using SEM, the cell densities of the L + E + N, 
L + E, and L + N groups were similar, but cell bodies in the L + E + N group 
were fuller and each had more than two pseudopodia. The expression level of IL-6 
mRNA in the L, L + N, L + E, and L + E + N groups was higher than in group C 
(P < 0.05), and the expression level of IL-8 mRNA in the L + E + N group was 
significantly lower than in group L (P < 0.0001). On day 7, the expression level 
of ALP mRNA in the L, L + N, L + E, and L + E + N groups was lower than in group 
C (P < 0.05). On day 14, there was no significant difference in the expression 
level of ALP mRNA among the L + N, L + E + N, and C groups (P > 0.05). On day 7, 
the expression level of RUNX2 mRNA in the L + E + N group was higher than in 
group L (P < 0.001). On day 14, the expression level of RUNX2 mRNA in the 
L + E + N group was higher than in group L (P < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: Twinlight laser treatment promoted cell proliferation, inhibited the 
expression of inflammatory cytokines, and effectively enhanced the osteogenic 
differentiation of cells on a titanium surface.

KMT2A-rearranged infant acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) represents the most 
refractory type of childhood leukemia. To uncover the molecular heterogeneity of 
this disease, we perform RNA sequencing, methylation array analysis, whole exome 
and targeted deep sequencing on 84 infants with KMT2A-rearranged leukemia. Our 
multi-omics clustering followed by single-sample and single-cell inference of 
hematopoietic differentiation establishes five robust integrative clusters (ICs) 
with different master transcription factors, fusion partners and corresponding 
stages of B-lymphopoietic and early hemato-endothelial development: IRX-type 
differentiated (IC1), IRX-type undifferentiated (IC2), HOXA-type MLLT1 (IC3), 
HOXA-type MLLT3 (IC4), and HOXA-type AFF1 (IC5). Importantly, our deep 
mutational analysis reveals that the number of RAS pathway mutations predicts 
prognosis and that the most refractory subgroup of IC2 possesses 100% frequency 
and the heaviest burden of RAS pathway mutations. Our findings highlight the 
previously under-appreciated intra- and inter-patient heterogeneity of 
KMT2A-rearranged infant ALL and provide a rationale for the future development 
of genomics-guided risk stratification and individualized therapy.

BACKGROUND: Kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) with "operational tolerance" 
(OT) maintain a functioning graft without immunosuppressive (IS) drugs, thus 
avoiding treatment complications. Nevertheless, IS drugs can influence 
gene-expression signatures aiming to identify OT among treated KTRs.
METHODS: We compared five published signatures of OT in peripheral blood samples 
from 18 tolerant, 183 stable, and 34 chronic rejector KTRs, using 
gene-expression levels with and without adjustment for IS drugs and regularised 
logistic regression.
FINDINGS: IS drugs explained up to 50% of the variability in gene-expression and 
20-30% of the variability in the probability of OT predicted by signatures 
without drug adjustment. We present a parsimonious consensus gene-set to 
identify OT, derived from joint analysis of IS-drug-adjusted expression of five 
published signature gene-sets. This signature, including CD40, CTLA4, HSD11B1, 
IGKV4-1, MZB1, NR3C2, and RAB40C genes, showed an area under the curve 0⋅92 (95% 
confidence interval 0⋅88-0⋅94) in cross-validation and 0⋅97 (0⋅93-1⋅00) in six 
months follow-up samples.
INTERPRETATION: We advocate including adjustment for IS drug therapy in the 
development stage of gene-expression signatures of OT to reduce the risk of 
capturing features of treatment, which could be lost following IS drug 
minimisation or withdrawal. Our signature, however, would require further 
validation in an independent dataset and a biomarker-led trial.

BACKGROUND: The optimal duration of infusion set use to prevent life-threatening 
catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) is unclear. We aimed to compare 
the effectiveness and costs of 7-day (intervention) versus 4-day (control) 
infusion set replacement to prevent CRBSI in patients with central venous access 
devices (tunnelled cuffed, non-tunnelled, peripherally inserted, and totally 
implanted) and peripheral arterial catheters.
METHODS: We did a randomised, controlled, assessor-masked trial at ten 
Australian hospitals. Our hypothesis was CRBSI equivalence for central venous 
access devices and non-inferiority for peripheral arterial catheters (both 2% 
margin). Adults and children with expected greater than 24 h central venous 
access device-peripheral arterial catheter use were randomly assigned (1:1; 
stratified by hospital, catheter type, and intensive care unit or ward) by a 
centralised, web-based service (concealed before allocation) to infusion set 
replacement every 7 days, or 4 days. This included crystalloids, non-lipid 
parenteral nutrition, and medication infusions. Patients and clinicians were not 
masked, but the primary outcome (CRBSI) was adjudicated by masked infectious 
diseases physicians. The analysis was modified intention to treat (mITT). This 
study is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry 
ACTRN12610000505000 and is complete.
FINDINGS: Between May 30, 2011, and Dec, 9, 2016, from 6007 patients assessed, 
we assigned 2944 patients to 7-day (n=1463) or 4-day (n=1481) infusion set 
replacement, with 2941 in the mITT analysis. For central venous access devices, 
20 (1·78%) of 1124 patients (7-day group) and 16 (1·46%) of 1097 patients (4-day 
group) had CRBSI (absolute risk difference [ARD] 0·32%, 95% CI -0·73 to 1·37). 
For peripheral arterial catheters, one (0·28%) of 357 patients in the 7-day 
group and none of 363 patients in the 4-day group had CRBSI (ARD 0·28%, -0·27% 
to 0·83%). There were no treatment-related adverse events.
INTERPRETATION: Infusion set use can be safely extended to 7 days with resultant 
cost and workload reductions.

BACKGROUND: Rituximab plus chemotherapy has been shown to be effective in 
patients with advanced-stage, previously untreated follicular lymphoma; 
nevertheless, most patients will have a relapse. Combination immunotherapy with 
lenalidomide and rituximab is an immunomodulatory regimen that has shown 
promising activity in patients with indolent B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
METHODS: We conducted this multicenter, international, phase 3 superiority trial 
to evaluate rituximab plus lenalidomide, as compared with rituximab plus 
chemotherapy, in patients with previously untreated follicular lymphoma. 
Patients were randomly assigned to receive one of the two regimens, followed by 
maintenance monotherapy with rituximab. Treatment with rituximab plus 
lenalidomide consisted of 18 cycles of the two drugs, followed by rituximab 
maintenance therapy every 8 weeks for 12 cycles (six additional doses). 
Treatment with rituximab plus chemotherapy consisted of the investigator's 
choice of one of three rituximab-based regimens, followed by maintenance 
monotherapy with rituximab every 8 weeks for 12 cycles. The primary end points 
were complete response (confirmed or unconfirmed) at 120 weeks and 
progression-free survival.
RESULTS: A total of 1030 patients were randomly assigned to receive rituximab 
plus lenalidomide (513 patients) or rituximab plus chemotherapy (517 patients). 
The rate of confirmed or unconfirmed complete response at 120 weeks was similar 
in the two groups: 48% (95% confidence interval [CI], 44 to 53) in the 
rituximab-lenalidomide group and 53% (95% CI, 49 to 57) in the 
rituximab-chemotherapy group (P=0.13). The interim 3-year rate of 
progression-free survival was 77% (95% CI, 72 to 80) and 78% (95% CI, 74 to 82), 
respectively. A higher percentage of patients in the rituximab-chemotherapy 
group had grade 3 or 4 neutropenia (32% vs. 50%) and febrile neutropenia of any 
grade (2% vs. 7%), and a higher percentage of patients in the 
rituximab-lenalidomide group had grade 3 or 4 cutaneous reactions (7% vs. 1%).
CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with previously untreated follicular lymphoma, 
efficacy results were similar with rituximab plus lenalidomide and rituximab 
plus chemotherapy (with both regimens followed by rituximab maintenance 
therapy). The safety profile differed in the two groups. (Funded by Celgene;

BACKGROUND: In patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, the effect of 
adding autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT) to triplet therapy 
(lenalidomide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone [RVD]), followed by lenalidomide 
maintenance therapy until disease progression, is unknown.
METHODS: In this phase 3 trial, adults (18 to 65 years of age) with symptomatic 
myeloma received one cycle of RVD. We randomly assigned these patients, in a 1:1 
ratio, to receive two additional RVD cycles plus stem-cell mobilization, 
followed by either five additional RVD cycles (the RVD-alone group) or high-dose 
melphalan plus ASCT followed by two additional RVD cycles (the transplantation 
group). Both groups received lenalidomide until disease progression, 
unacceptable side effects, or both. The primary end point was progression-free 
survival.
RESULTS: Among 357 patients in the RVD-alone group and 365 in the 
transplantation group, at a median follow-up of 76.0 months, 328 events of 
disease progression or death occurred; the risk was 53% higher in the RVD-alone 
group than in the transplantation group (hazard ratio, 1.53; 95% confidence 
interval [CI], 1.23 to 1.91; P<0.001); median progression-free survival was 46.2 
months and 67.5 months. The percentage of patients with a partial response or 
better was 95.0% in the RVD-alone group and 97.5% in the transplantation group 
(P = 0.55); 42.0% and 46.8%, respectively, had a complete response or better 
(P = 0.99). Treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or higher occurred in 
78.2% and 94.2%, respectively; 5-year survival was 79.2% and 80.7% (hazard ratio 
for death, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.73 to 1.65).
CONCLUSIONS: Among adults with multiple myeloma, RVD plus ASCT was associated 
with longer progression-free survival than RVD alone. No overall survival 
benefit was observed. (Funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute

Dysregulated immune responses against the SARS-CoV-2 virus are instrumental in 
severe COVID-19. However, the immune signatures associated with immunopathology 
are poorly understood. Here we use multi-omics single-cell analysis to probe the 
dynamic immune responses in hospitalized patients with stable or progressive 
course of COVID-19, explore V(D)J repertoires, and assess the cellular effects 
of tocilizumab. Coordinated profiling of gene expression and cell lineage 
protein markers shows that S100Ahi/HLA-DRlo classical monocytes and activated 
LAG-3hi T cells are hallmarks of progressive disease and highlights the abnormal 
MHC-II/LAG-3 interaction on myeloid and T cells, respectively. We also find 
skewed T cell receptor repertories in expanded effector CD8+ clones, unmutated 
IGHG+ B cell clones, and mutated B cell clones with stable somatic hypermutation 
frequency over time. In conclusion, our in-depth immune profiling reveals 
dyssynchrony of the innate and adaptive immune interaction in progressive 
COVID-19.
